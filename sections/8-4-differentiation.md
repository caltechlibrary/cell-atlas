description: Caulobacter crescentus bacteria have a dimorphic lifecycle, dividing asymmetrically into a surface-attached stalked cell and a motile swarmer cell
---

While all cells go through cycles of growth and quiescence in response to changes in their environment, some species have gone a step further to evolve a programmed set of states–a **lifecycle**. In some cases, as you will see in the next chapter, a lifecycle allows bacteria to prey efficiently on other cells, including ours. In other cases, such as these *Caulobacter crescentus*, it allows the bacterium to thrive in an environment with low nutrient levels. *C. crescentus* has a **dimorphic** (“two form”) lifecycle. Newborn cells start out life as **swarmers**, with a polar flagellum. They swim through the environment (either freshwater or saltwater) until they (hopefully) reach a favorable spot to put down roots, which they do by first transiently attaching to a surface with pili, then making the attachment permanent with a polymer of a sticky protein called “**holdfast**,” which currently holds the record for the strongest known biological adhesive (⇩). They shed their flagellum and grow a stalk in its place. Only after growing a stalk, completing the process of differentiation, will the cell begin to divide. The **stalked cell** will remain attached to the surface for the rest of its life, dividing asymmetrically to produce new swarmer cells, which swim away to try their luck elsewhere. Here you see a swarmer cell on the bottom, and a stalked cell on the top, in the process of dividing to produce another swarmer that would swim off to the right. You saw a similar dimorphic lifecycle in Chapter 5, in sessile (non-motile) *Hyphomonas neptunium* that bud to produce motile daughters. This kind of lifecycle helps prevent related cells from competing with one another for scarce local nutrients.
