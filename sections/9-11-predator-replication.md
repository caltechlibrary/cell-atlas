description: Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus prey on other diderm bacteria like Vibrio cholerae. They digest the contents of the prey cytoplasm to fuel growth and division
---

Once inside its host, *Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus* has the leisure to grow and replicate. From its position in the periplasm, the *B. bacteriovorus* cell proceeds to digest the contents of the host cytoplasm, which shrinks down to a dense ball of material. This meal provides the fuel necessary for the *B. bacteriovorus* to grow to several times its original length and undergo a synchronous division to produce several (usually between 2 and 7) daughters. The number of progeny depends on the size of the host cell: two in the case of this relatively small *Vibrio cholerae*. The progeny, reset to the attack phase (note the condensed nucleoids), finally lyse what is left of the host to swim off in search of their next victims.
