Once the septum is in place, it is then extended, as you can see in this *Bacillus subtilis*, enlarging the nascent spore and ultimately separating it from the mother cell envelope. Note that the monoderm mother is producing a diderm spore, surrounded by two layers of its mother’s membrane. As this occurs, a copy of the genome is pumped through a specialized protein nanomachine. The increased turgor pressure from the highly-concentrated DNA helps the **forespore** round and expand. Usually, the mother cell membrane finishes closing off at the cell pole, but occasionally this occurs instead on the side of the mother cell (⇩).

When the process of **engulfment** is finished, the forespore’s cell wall is reinforced and expanded into a tough “**cortex**,” and an extra protein **coat** is added to the outside, completing the sturdy envelope that will protect the spore from harsh environments (⇩). Finally, when the spore is ready, the mother cell lyses, releasing the time capsule to its fate.
