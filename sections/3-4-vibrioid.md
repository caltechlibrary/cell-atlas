description: Vibrioid cells of Caulobacter crescentus bacteria use cytoskeletal filaments of Crescentin and CTP synthase to make their curved shape.

What if you want to curve your rod-shaped cell into a comma? **Vibrioid** shape (named for the genus *Vibrio*, where it is common) may help cells swim faster. To make a vibrioid cell wall, you can imagine the contractor simply telling the workers to incorporate more material on one side of the rod relative to the other. In *Caulobacter crescentus* like this one, this is the function of two cytoskeletal proteins. The first, called (for an obvious reason) **Crescentin**, inhibits cell wall synthesis. It is kept in check by the second, called **CTP synthase**. (As its name implies, CTP synthase has another, metabolic, function in the cell (â‡©).) The balance between the two makes sure the cell curves, but not too much. Such checks and balances are a common theme in nature. Both cytoskeletal proteins localize to one side of the cell, resulting in more cell wall growth on the opposite side, and a curved cell. Here you can see a bundle of CTP synthase filaments on the inner curvature of the cell. The form of Crescentin is more elusive; we only see obvious filaments when it is artificially overexpressed, so its exact structure in the cell remains unclear.

This system is only one way of making a curved cell. There must be others since many vibrioid species (including *Vibrio*!) do not use Crescentin. As you will see throughout this book, there is no shortage of biological questions still to be figured out.
