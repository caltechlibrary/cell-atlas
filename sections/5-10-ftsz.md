description: Archaea and bacteria like Caulobacter crescentus use cytoskeletal filaments of FtsZ to constrict their cell envelope during cytokinesis
---

As cytokinesis progresses, FtsZ filaments keep assembling and growing, soon forming a complete ring of long, overlapping filaments around the full circumference of the cell. This drives further constriction more or less uniformly. In this *Caulobacter crescentus* cell in a later stage of division, you can see many FtsZ filaments lined up in cross-sectionâ€“the dots on both sides of the division plane. If we rotate the cell around, you can see filaments extending on both sides as far as the membrane is visible. (*See the note on the previous page about why we cannot trace the membrane and filaments all the way around.*) They will continue to pull the membrane inward, and direct cell wall to be built behind it, until cytokinesis is complete.
