description: Viruses like myophage use their contractile tails to inject their genomes into bacteria like Bacteroidetes. Not all phage have contractile tails
---

Once docked, the phage delivers its cargo. The tails of some, but not all, phage are contractile, punching a channel through the cellâ€™s envelope to inject the genome, emptying the capsid as you see in this myophage infecting a *Bacteroidetes* cell. This syringe-like mechanism should be familiar from the related contractile weapons discussed in the last chapter. (You can watch an animation of a contractile myophage tail in action on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_CnXmoZwbI).)
