Still other species are **peritrichous** (“hair all around”), with multiple flagella distributed randomly around the cell, as you can see on this *Pseudomonas flexibilis*. The number of flagella varies between different species, from relatively few here to considerably more (⇩). The well-known model system *Escherichia coli* is also peritrichously flagellated. In this arrangement, when the flagellar motors are all rotating one direction (counter-clockwise), the flagella form a whip-like bundle that propels the cell to “run” in a straight line. When one or more motors switch to clockwise rotation, the flagella dissociate from the bundle and “tumble” the cell to face a new direction. In the next chapter, you will see how cells use this behavior to seek out favorable spots.
