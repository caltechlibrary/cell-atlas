The hexagonal array structure of chemosensory systems is invariant across species, and even across domains. As you can see in this *Methanospirillum hungatei*, the arrays have the same architecture in archaea as in bacteria, with 12 nm center-to-center spacing between the hexagons. This strong conservation indicates the importance of chemotaxis for cellsâ€™ fitness, and suggests that evolution had already honed it to a relatively optimal form in the common ancestor of all these cells.
