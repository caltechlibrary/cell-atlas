Like monoderms, most diderms divide into roughly equally-sized daughter cells, but not all do. Just like the *Tetrasphaera remsis* you saw earlier, some diderm species produce one larger, and one smaller, daughter, like this *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*. In this case, this is because the smaller daughter is technically a bud. *A. tumefaciens* concentrate their growth at one pole, pushing out a bud that, once it becomes large enough, is pinched off and released. The process is very similar to what you saw in *Hyphomonas neptunium*, just without the intervening stalk.
