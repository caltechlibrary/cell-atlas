description: Podophage use short tails that extend after docking to deliver their genomes into bacteria like Vibrio cholerae. Phage capsids have a variety of shapes
---

Not all phage tails are so long. Podophage (which this unidentified attacker of a *Vibrio cholerae* may be) have short tails that extend after docking to cross the host envelope. Other phage lack tails entirely.

Similarly, heads can look very different. The unique rocket-ship shape of this phageâ€™s capsid highlights the diversity of phage morphology. Some, mostly infecting archaea in extreme environments, have heads shaped like bottles or lemons. Others take the form of long, thin filaments.
