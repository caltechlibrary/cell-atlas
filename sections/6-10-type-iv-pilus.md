If your cell lives on a surface, what is the best way to get around? How about using a grappling hook? Some bacteria, like this *Myxococcus xanthus*, use a type II secretion system related to the archaellar motor to pull themselves around their environment. As you can see, the structure looks familiar: a motor embedded in the envelope attached to a long extracellular filament. In this case the filament is called a pilus (“hair” in Latin). Bacteria and archaea make many kinds of pili (also generically called fimbriae (“fringe”)) and you will see some of their other functions in later chapters. The *M. xanthus* pili, classified as **type IV pili**, function not as propellers like flagella or archaella, but rather extend linearly, stick to a surface at the tip, and then retract to pull the cell toward the attachment point (⇩). (You can watch a video of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* moving with Type IV pili on [Howard Berg's website](http://www.rowland.harvard.edu/labs/bacteria/movies/pseudo.php).) The pilus motors are the strongest known motors in nature, and can retract pili at up to 1 μm/s; the combined action of multiple pili leads to extremely rapid “twitching” motility of the cell over a surface. The motor structure, or basal body, remains intact even when no pilus is assembled. These rod-shaped cells have many basal bodies at both cell poles; to switch direction, the cell simply disassembles the pili on one end and builds new pili from the machines waiting on the other.

In addition to attaching to a surface, the pili can also stick to other *M. xanthus* cells. This enables the cells to move over surfaces *en masse*. Combined with their practice of eating other bacteria, this property has led them to be compared to packs of wolves hunting down their prey.
