description: During cytokinesis, the outer membrane of diderm bacteria like Caulobacter crescentus constricts with, or after, the cell wall, depending on the species
---

In some species, the outer membrane constricts at the same time as the inner membrane, as you saw, for instance, in the *Thiomonas intermedia* cell at the beginning of this chapter. In others, including the cells you saw on the last page, the outer membrane is mainly remodeled at the end of the process, as the cells separate. Other species are intermediate. In *Caulobacter crescentus*, the outer membrane constricts along with the inner membrane and cell wall. At the end of division, though, the inner membrane seals off before the outer membrane, as you can see in this cell, which is at a very late stage of division. For an even later stage, see the example in the Learn More section (â‡©).
