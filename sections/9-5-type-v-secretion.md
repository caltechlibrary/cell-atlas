Other secretion systems independently evolved similar mechanisms, though using very different structures. Some strains of *Escherichia coli* have an ability, called “<u>C</u>ontact-<u>D</u>ependent <u>I</u>nhibition” or **CDI**, to inhibit the growth of neighboring diderm bacterial cells. They do this by coopting a pore in the outer membrane of the target cell to introduce a toxin that halts its growth. To safeguard themselves, they make an antitoxin that binds to the toxin and renders it harmless. Such antidote systems are common for microbe-produced toxins.

To deliver the toxin to the target, the cells use type V secretion systems (**T5SSs**) like the ones on this *Escherichia coli*. In contrast to the nanomachines you have been seeing so far, which contain dozens of unique components, this system is elegantly spare, using just two proteins and a mechanism reminiscent of a medieval ball-and-chain flail (⇩).

*Note: This cell belongs to a strain that is normally incapable of CDI, but has been genetically engineered to produce the T5SS components. Once again, this lets us image the machines more easily; in this case, the CDI-practicing strain has a thicker layer of extracellular proteins, which would obscure the needles in a visual haystack.*
