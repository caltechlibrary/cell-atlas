description: Virus-associated pyramids open the membrane of Sulfolobus solfataricus archaea to release Sulfolobus Turreted Icosahedral Virus
---

When the STIV phage is ready to make its great escape, a still-unknown signal triggers the pyramids to open along their seams, peeling back to create 100 nm-wide holes for the phage, and all the other contents of the cell, to pour out, as you can see in this lysed *Sulfolobus solfataricus* cell infected with the same virus.
