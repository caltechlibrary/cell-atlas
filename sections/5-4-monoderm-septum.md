description: In cytokinesis, bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus build a septum of cell wall to divide into two daughter cells
---

Once your cell has gotten everything where it needs to go, how can it actually divide? Just as fences separate neighbors, why not use the cell wall to build a **septum** (“fence”) between the two daughters? That’s what this *Staphylococcus aureus* cell is doing, using its cell wall to begin **cytokinesis**–the physical division of the cytoplasm. In monoderm bacteria like this, with a thick cell wall, the septum is easy to see.

*Staphylococcus aureus* gets its name from the clusters of cells produced by repeated rounds of division, resembling grapes (or "staphyli" in Greek).
