If your cell is a pathogen, swimming can be very useful, but so can burrowing, for instance between cells in host tissue. To do this, why not turn your cell into a corkscrew with the equipment at hand? Some cells do just this, wrapping their flagellum around their body to back out of a tight spot, or burrow into one. Other, diderm species like the *Borrelia burgdorferi* here have turned the temporary adaptation into a permanent one: they assemble their flagella *inside* the cell envelope, with the filaments wrapping around between the cell wall and outer membrane. These “**periplasmic**” **flagella** are usually multiple, arising from one or both ends of the cell, and pack together into a helical ribbon whose rotation drives wave-like motion of the cell (you can watch a video of this movement on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ODYu--TNPDE)). The helical ribbon helps give these spirochetes (“spiral haired”) their characteristic shape; mutants that cannot make flagella are simple rods. Some spirochetes also have additional features that may help them move around in animal hosts (⇩).
