description: In cytokinesis, diderm bacteria like Idiomarina loihiensis and Sphingopyxis alaskensis constrict their inner membranes and cells walls to divide
---

The cytokinesis process is similar for diderm bacteria, as you can see in this *Idiomarina loihiensis* cell, with the cell wall and inner membrane growing inward. The process is almost complete here, with just a thin channel of cytoplasm in the very middle connecting the daughter cells. Notice the cell wall zippering apart at the edges of the septum. For another example slightly earlier in the process, check out the Learn More (â‡©).
