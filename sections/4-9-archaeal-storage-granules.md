Archaea also use storage granules, and you will see many examples throughout the book. Compared to the relatively smooth surface of bacterial granules, the edges of some archaeal granules are spikier, giving them a rougher appearance, as in this *Halorubrum litoreum* cell. Others are smooth and, just like in bacteria, they exhibit a range of morphologies depending on what they store. For instance, compare the granules in the Learn More section (â‡©).
