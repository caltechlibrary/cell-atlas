description: Bacteria like Agrobacterium tumefaciens or Halothiobacillus neapolitanus use various storage granules, which also interact with carboxysomes

Some types of storage granules, like poly-phosphate and poly-hydroxybutyrate, are very densely packed and clearly delineated from the rest of the cytoplasm. Others are less tightly packed and more amorphous, like the ones in this *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* cell. We do not yet know what these contain.

In some species, like the *Cupriavidus necator* on the last page, storage granules seem to be positioned randomly in the cell. Other species have more regulated arrangements. *A. tumefaciens* cells always have one poly-phosphate storage granule, located near a cell pole. Other species have one at each end of the cell. As we will discuss in Chapter 5, this arrangement can help mother cells deliver a storage granule to each of their daughters during division.

You might expect a close relationship between cellular factories and storage depots. In fact, there does seem to be a relationship between carboxysomes and storage granules, although the details remain unclear (â‡©).
