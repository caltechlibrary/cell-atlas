description: Viruses like siphophage use long, non-contractile tails to deliver their genomes into bacteria like Shewanella oneidensis
---

Some phage have tails that are not contractile, like this siphophage attacking a *Shewanella oneidensis* cell. The long, flexible tail still serves the essential function of crossing the barrier of the cellâ€™s envelope, providing a conduit for the genome to enter the cell.

Note that you already saw a different type of phage attacking *S. oneidensis*. While most phage are adapted to infect one or a few closely-related species of bacteria or archaea, there are often multiple different types of phage adapted to attack each species. The diversity of phage is staggering, and they have  diverged considerably through evolution. One lacks a single gene with detectable homology to any other in any known virus or cell.
