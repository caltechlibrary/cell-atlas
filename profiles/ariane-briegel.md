Ariane Briegel is Professor of Ultrastructural Biology at the Leiden University (The Netherlands) and co-director of the Dutch Center for Electron Nanoscopy (NeCEN). She earned her PhD in the laboratory of Prof. Wolfgang Baumeister at the Max Planck Institute in Martinsried Germany. Here, she learned the power of Electron Tomography to study microbes in three dimensions and at macromolecular resolution. She continued to explore the wonders of bacterial structure and function in the laboratory of Grant Jensen as a postdoc and research scientist. She  has 20 years of experience using cryo-electron microscopy to study bacterial and archaeal ultrastructure. The Briegel laboratory focuses on investigating how microbes sense and respond to their environment using cryoEM methods.
