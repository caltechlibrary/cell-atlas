William J Nicolas is a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech in the Jensen and Meyerowitz labs. Plant biologist and electron microscopist at heart, he received his doctorate from the University of Bordeaux (France) working on the ultrastructure of the nanopores connecting plant cells to one-another called plasmodesmata. He joined Caltech in the Jensen and Meyerowitz labs at the beginning of 2018 to work in the still vastly unexplored field of cryo-EM on the plant cell wall and cellulosic bacterial biofilms.
