Martin Pilhofer is a Professor in the Institute of Molecular Biology & Biophysics at ETH Zürich in Switzerland. He earned his PhD in microbiology from the Technical University of Munich, working with Karl-Heinz Schleifer on bacterial phyla with unique cellular features. Recognizing the power of cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) to characterize these structures, he joined Grant Jensen’s lab at Caltech as a postdoc in 2008, where he used cryo-ET to reveal several fascinating bacterial structures, including cytoskeletal elements and contractile weaponry. In 2014 he established his own lab in Zürich, where he leads a team applying cryo-ET to understand these and other macromolecular machines mediating bacterial cell-cell interactions.
