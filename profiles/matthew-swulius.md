Matt Swulius received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas Health Science Center where he studied developmental changes in synaptic signaling complexes under Dr. Neal Waxham. He then did his postdoc at Caltech, with Dr. Grant Jensen, where he studied the microbial cytoskeleton using cryo-electron tomography. Now Matt has his own lab at the Penn State College of Medicine, where he uses his training in cryo-EM to study neuronal ultrastructure.
