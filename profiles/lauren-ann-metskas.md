Dr. Lauren Ann Metskas studied the conformational dynamics of disordered proteins during her PhD in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale University.  After graduating in 2016, she transitioned to correlated cryo-fluorescence and cryo-electron microscopy methods development during her first postdoctoral position with the Briggs group at EMBL-Heidelberg and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Lauren Ann joined the Jensen lab in 2018, whereupon she discovered a new interest in using tomography to study bacterial microcompartments and outer membrane vesicles. She is now an Assistant Professor in the Biological Sciences and Chemistry departments of Purdue University.
