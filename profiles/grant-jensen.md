Grant J. Jensen is a Professor of Biology and Biophysics at Caltech. He earned his doctorate in Biophysics from Stanford, working on electron microscopy of RNA polymerase and other protein complexes with Dr. Roger Kornberg. He continued his work in protein electron microscopy as a Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell post-doctoral fellow under the supervision of Dr. Kenneth Downing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Here his interests expanded to include electron tomography of whole cells. Grant launched his own lab at Caltech in 2002, where his research has focused on three main areas: the ultrastructure of small cells, the structural biology of HIV, and the further development of cryoEM technology. Most of the cryotomograms featured in this atlas were collected by members of his lab while working with him at Caltech. Grant moved in 2020 to Brigham Young University to become Dean of the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences.
