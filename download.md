for mobile devices), choose one of the options below. The full version (13.0GB)
contains full-resolution 1080p videos; the light version (5.42GB) contains
reduced-size 480p videos. These packages are also available from the Caltech

The PDF version contains only the text and static images, and we recommend viewing it in a two-page layout. Note that the offline book won't have any updates that occurred since you downloaded it, so please check back here periodically for new editions.
