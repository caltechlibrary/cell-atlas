## About the Project

This open-access educational resource is provided by the [Caltech Library](https://www.library.caltech.edu/). It is an experiment in multimedia digital publishing. As such, it will keep evolving to take advantage of new tools to share information, and to reflect current scientific knowledge. Initially released in December 2020, the textbook is updated frequently, so check [What’s New](#WhatsNew) to see what's changed.

You can find more information about how the book was built, content and navigation, and acknowledgments in the [Introduction](introduction.html).

## For Educators

We hope this book will help your students appreciate what bacterial and archaeal cells look like and the macromolecular machinery that underlies their diverse biological processes. The main narrative content is targeted to undergraduate-level students and requires nothing but a familiarity with basic concepts in biology. More advanced students, such as those in a microbiology course, will find additional details in the Learn More sections. The main content can be digested in several hours, and we recommend assigning it as a supplemental resource to accompany the first few sessions of a course, as an introduction to bacterial and archaeal cells before you dive into more specialized aspects of their biology such as metabolism or medical relevance. The summaries at the end of each chapter provide some concept check questions that can be used to test students’ retention of the content. As we add new content and features in future editions, we’ll highlight the changes in [What’s New](#WhatsNew) so you can keep your course materials up to date. 

If you do use this book in a class, please give us some [Feedback](#feedbackForm){.feedbackLink} about what you and your students liked, what we could improve, and ideas for features you’d like to see in future editions.
