The overall architecture of the helical archaellum is similar to that of the bacterial flagellum, as you can see in this structure from *Methanospirillum hungatei* [@poweleit2016]. Each protein subunit is smaller, however, resulting in a narrower filament diameter: ~10 nm, compared to ~24 nm for the flagellum. They are also more tightly packed, so there is no central channel. And, unlike flagella, the filament assembles from the base.
