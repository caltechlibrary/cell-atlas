Some cells assemble a few, scattered type VI secretion systems. Other species, like this *Amoebophilus asiaticus* build ordered arrays of parallel machines. These diderm bacteria live symbiotically inside amoebae. Their T6SS batteries help them colonize their host, perhaps by rupturing the membrane of the host phagosome that encloses them after they are engulfed, releasing them into the host cytoplasm. The number of T6SSs in each array varies, but can reach a few dozen.
