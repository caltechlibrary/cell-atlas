Lipoproteins are hybrid molecules, formed from covalently-linked lipid and protein pieces. The lipid allows them to embed into a membrane, tethering the attached protein to function nearby. Braun's lipoprotein, or **Lpp** [@shu2000], is one of the most abundant molecules in the outer membrane of cells like *Escherichia coli*. The top of the trimeric protein "coiled-coil" shown here contains the lipid tether. The bottom binds the peptidoglycan, creating a rigid link between the outer membrane and the cell wall that sets the distance between the two layers. A typical *E. coli* cell may contain 100,000 such links. Some other species use different proteins for the same purpose.
