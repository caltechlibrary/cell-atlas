This diderm *Sporomusa acidovorans* cell is in the process of forming an ovoid endospore. Note also what may be an early stage of cortex formation at the end of the forespore, as well as novel structures at the points of cell wall remodeling. We do not know what they are, but they may be involved in engulfment.
