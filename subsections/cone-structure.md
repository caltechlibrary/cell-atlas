The archaellar plate does not come to a point at the tip, but rather is a conical frustum (open at the top), resembling a lampshade. In the center of the tip is a small ring, as you can see in a top view in this lysed, flattened *Thermococcus kodakaraensis* cell. The function of the ring remains unknown; perhaps it nucleates the rest of the structure?
