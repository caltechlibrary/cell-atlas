Bactofilins are found in many species of bacteria and archaea, suggesting that they perform diverse (and currently unknown) functions. They polymerize into very stable filaments with a triangular beta-helical structure, like this one from *Thermus thermophilus* [@deng2019]. Bactofilin filaments lack two hallmarks of actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeletal elements: polarity and dynamic assembly/disassembly. In this way, they are similar to intermediate filaments in eukaryotic cytoskeletons.
