Encasing your cell in a rigid scaffold presents a problem: how can it grow? It is easy to make membranes larger simply by adding more lipids. But to add more peptidoglycan strands, they must be linked into the existing network, which means breaking existing links to accommodate them. To do this, cells use three tools: an enzyme that links glycan sugars into strands, an enzyme that links glycan strands together with peptide bonds, and an enzyme that cuts these peptide links to allow new strands to be incorporated. Remember, though, that your cell, with its solute-rich interior, has a turgor pressure pushing outward with a force of perhaps 3 atmospheres, equivalent to what we would feel at a depth of 20 meters in the ocean. This is more than enough pressure to lyse an exposed membrane, so the tools must be wielded with care or the cell would burst. We are still figuring out how this works, with help from computer simulations like this one by [Lam Nguyen](#lam_nguyen). Here you see a model of an *Escherichia coli* cell wall being enlarged using the three enzyme tools we just described (the colored balls). This simulation was run to test whether just having the tools function in a complex rather than separately might provide enough coordination for safe growth [@nguyen2015]. (The answer was yes. You can watch the full movie describing this research on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5Ov3vp6Qyg).)
