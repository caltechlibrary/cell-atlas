Unlike the symmetric bilayer of the inner membrane, the two leaflets of the outer membrane are different. The inner leaflet consists of familiar phospholipids. In most diderms, though, the outer leaflet is composed mainly of **lipopolysaccharide**, or **LPS**, molecules. These molecules have lipid portions which interact with the lipids of the inner leaflet and again form a barrier against hydrophilic molecules. They also have sugar portions, which extend out from the cell and present an additional barrier to hydrophobic molecules [@tang2019]. The dense LPS layer protects the cell from things like antibiotics and, for pathogens, the defenses of the host. On the flip side, our immune systems have evolved to detect and strongly react to LPS molecules.
