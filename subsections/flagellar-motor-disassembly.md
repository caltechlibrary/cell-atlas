When flagella break (or in some species, like *Caulobacter crescentus*, are ejected so the cell can attach to a surface), the motor is disassembled, usually beginning with the export apparatus. Not everything is dismantled, though; the P- and L-rings remain in place in the cell wall and outer membrane, respectively, as you can see in this *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. We do not know if the cell has a reason to leave them there, but one possibility is that they may function as a plug so that loss of the hook does not create a hole in the outer membrane.
