Different species can produce outer membrane vesicles that look very different. Even vesicles from the same species can look very different. Sometimes they come off the cell as a chain of spheres; sometimes the spheres remain connected, like a string of pearls, as in this *Borrelia burgdorferi*. Sometimes vesicles form long tubes instead (â‡¨). Sometimes the same chain can be tubular in one section (usually at the base, connected to the cell), and a string of spheres in another.
