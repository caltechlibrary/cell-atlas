To identify the location of a component within a large macromolecular complex, **difference mapping** can be helpful. In this approach, the gene corresponding to that component is either knocked out or a tag, like GFP, is added that will make the protein larger. A sub-tomogram average of the complex is produced and compared to a sub-tomogram average of the complex from wild-type (unmodified) cells. Often, a difference in the structure is visible, corresponding to the missing or altered component. Here you see an example of how this was used to locate a component of the flagellar motor, a protein called FliI, in *Campylobacter jejuni* [@henderson2020].
