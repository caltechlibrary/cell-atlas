This average of type II secretion systems from many *Legionella pneumophila* cells shows the overall structure: a channel through the cell envelope, gated near the outer membrane [@ghosal2019]. The pseudo-pilus, whose structure is shown here, can be seen in individual T2SSs, extending from the inner membrane to the bottom of the main channel. It gets washed out in the average, though, indicating that it is relatively flexible (i.e. not always in the same position). We still need to figure out exactly how the system works, including whether the pseudo-pilus does act like a piston, and how the gate opens.
