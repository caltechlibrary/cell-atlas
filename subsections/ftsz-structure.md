While the structure of FtsZ is known, as seen here from *Staphylococcus aureus* [@wagstaff2017], its mechanism is not. It is an enzyme that hydrolyzes GTP, so one hypothesis is that the curvature of the filament changes as the chemical reaction drives subunits from one conformation to another. This different filament conformation may pull inward on the attached membrane, allowing the cell wall to build inward behind it.
