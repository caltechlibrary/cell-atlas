*Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea* produce mysterious, massive arrays of MACs, contractile machines related to T6SSs. Cells lyse to release the arrays, like the one you see here, which can contain 100 individual MACs and extend more than 1 μm across. The arrays are highly ordered, with the tail fibers of the MACs networked into a hexagonal array that may help synchronize firing (⇨). MAC arrays serve an important function for larvae of the marine tubeworm *Hydroides elegans*, and likely the larvae of other invertebrates such as sea urchins and corals as well. They signal to the larva that it is the right place to settle down and differentiate into a sessile (surface-attached) adult. The function of MAC arrays for the bacterium is less clear. It may be that the invertebrates benefit the lysed cell’s surviving relatives in the biofilm. Or perhaps the MACs play another, completely unrelated role.

*Note: This MAC array was produced by a cell lacking genes encoding other contractile weaponry (type VI secretion systems and a related machine called a bacteriocin). This was done to make it easier to identify the MACs.*
