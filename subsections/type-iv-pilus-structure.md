A series of rings anchors the type IV pilus basal body in the cell envelope. This rigid structure provides leverage for an ATPase at the base to rotate an adaptor in the inner membrane. We think that when it spins in one direction, the adaptor rotates to lock pilin monomers that diffuse from the inner membrane into the assembling pilus [@chang2016]. Once the pilus has reached its target, attachment is sensed by the basal body (we do not yet know how). As a result, the assembly ATPase dissociates and a second, homologous ATPase takes its place. This disassembly ATPase spins the adaptor in the opposite direction, ushering pilin monomers back into the inner membrane, ready to join the next growing pilus.
