This *Acetonema longum* cell has completed engulfment of the forespore. *A. longum* forespores (and mature spores) typically contain several granules, likely storing poly-phosphate. These may help power outgrowth when the spore germinates. Spores from other species, though, like *Bacillus subtilis*, do not contain obvious storage granules, so they may serve another, species-specific role.
