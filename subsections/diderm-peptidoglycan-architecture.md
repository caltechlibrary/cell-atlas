Compare this diderm cell wall purified from *Escherichia coli* to the monoderm cell wall on the last page. Since this one is thinner, we can make out more details, like the bundles of glycan strands running around the circumference of the cell. The main difference between the two types of walls seems to be whether they have largely a single layer of peptidoglycan (diderm) or many layers (monoderm). So even though the two look different, their architecture is fundamentally the same. In some circumstances, as you will see in Chapter 8, cells can even switch between the two forms.
