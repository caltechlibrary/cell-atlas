This *Vibrio cholerae* cell showcases a full complement of chemosensory systems: an extensive membrane-embedded array (signaling to the flagellar motor) and a cytoplasmic array (signaling to a still-unknown target). In each case, the basic architecture is identical: hexagonally-arranged trimers of chemoreceptor dimers.
