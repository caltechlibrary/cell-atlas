This average of type IV secretion systems from many *Legionella pneumophila* cells shows the overall structure [@ghosal2019a]. (You can watch a more detailed version of the animation on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/mJk9xNdoTzQ).) We do not yet know how secretion works, but one possibility is that effectors are transported either straight through the channel from the cytoplasm and/or first into the periplasm and from there into the windowed chamber just inside the outer membrane before finally being escorted out of the cell. *Animation by Janet Iwasa.*
