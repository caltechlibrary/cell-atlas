The cell wall is so robust that it persists even after cells are lysed and their other components digested. This cell wall isolated from a *Bacillus subtilis* cell has retained its shape, simply flattening with the release of contents and pressure from inside. The way the cell wall crumples is one clue to its architecture: the long glycan strands form hoops parallel to the short axis of the cylindrical cell and the short peptide crosslinks are more or less aligned with the long axis.
