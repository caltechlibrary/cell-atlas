This *Helicobacter pylori* cell was cultured together with human gastric epithelial cells, its target for infection. It contains inactive type IV secretion systems, as well as several mysterious tubes. The tubes are formed from the outer membrane, but we do not know what scaffolds them (they have a consistent diameter of 37 nm and a helical protein scaffold inside), or what makes the portals along their length. The fact that we sometimes see tubes near inactive T4SSs suggests a relationship, but the details are unclear. Much remains mysterious about this structure and its potential role in infection.
