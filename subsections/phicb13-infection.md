Here you see several φCb13 phage that have successfully reached their target receptors at the pole of a *Caulobacter crescentus* and are in the process of infecting the cell (note the mix of filled capsids that have not yet released their genome and empty capsids that have). This particularly unlucky cell has already been infected by a different kind of phage, as you can see from the capsids assembling inside (more on that process on the next page).
