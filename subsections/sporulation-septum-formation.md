From hundreds of sporulating *Bacillus subtilis* we imaged by cryo-ET, this is the only cell captured in the process of forming a septum. As you can see, it is at a very early stage in the process. The fact that we do not see more intermediates suggests that once the septum starts to form, it quickly proceeds to completion.
