RuBisCO is a compact protein complex, as you can see in this structure from *Thiomonas intermedia* [@oltrogge2020]. It is made of eight copies each of a large and a small component (shown in dark and light green, respectively), forming parallel assembly lines to make useful organic carbon from CO<sub>2</sub>. One set is highlighted in grey.
