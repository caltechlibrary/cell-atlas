The carboxysomes in this *Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus* have grown abnormally long, extending across the full width of the cell. The length of these is unusual, but minor elongations are more common.

This cell also highlights the lability in the outer membrane common in some bacterial species, particularly pathogens. Note how the cell has curled inside its loose outer membrane. You can also see part of it stretching across to another cell in a neighboring hole; they were probably just finishing division when they were pulled apart by sample preparation.
