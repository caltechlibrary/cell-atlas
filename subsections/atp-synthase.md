Cells take advantage of the phospholipid bilayer's impermeability to charged molecules to establish an ion gradient across the membrane, using a chain of electron-carrying proteins in the membrane to pump protons out of the cell. Protein complexes in the membrane called ATP synthases, like this one from *Escherichia coli* [@sobti2016], use the resulting ion potential to generate energy. The portion of the complex in the membrane provides a conduit for protons to flow down their potential, producing a "proton-motive force" that spins the rotor, generating energy that is chemically stored in <u>A</u>denosine <u>T</u>ri<u>p</u>hosphate (ATP), the energetic currency of the cell. (You can watch an animation illustrating this process on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXpzp4RDGJI).)

For this reason, we say that the membrane is “energized.” Holes in the membrane allow the ion gradient to equilibrate, destroying the cell’s means of generating energy, and thus its life.
