Cytoplasmic vesicles exhibit a variety of sizes and shapes. Some are nested, with vesicles inside vesicles. In this *Prosthecobacter debontii* cell, you can see two other morphologies. One resembles a flattened horseshoe. Another is a more typical spherical shape, but is decorated with what look like protein complexes.

This cell also has unusual structures on its surface that have yet to be identified.
