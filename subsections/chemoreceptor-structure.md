Chemoreceptors take the form of long rods. A single protein zips back along itself, and then joins together with a second copy, forming a rigid bundle of four intertwining helices (two from each member of the dimer), as you can see in this dimer of receptors from *Thermotoga maritima* [@park2006]. Only the cytoplasmic portion is shown here; in the cell, the receptors would also have a membrane-embedded anchor at the top and, beyond that, a small domain in the periplasm (or outside the cell in a monoderm) to bind the chemical of interest. Once a chemical binds, the signal is transmitted down the length of the receptor to a kinase waiting at the distal tip.
