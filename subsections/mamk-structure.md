MamK, like its eukaryotic homologue, actin, polymerizes into double-stranded filaments like this one from *Magnetospirillum magneticum* [@bergeron2017]. Unlike eukaryotic actin, though, the two strands are aligned in register, rather than being staggered so that the bumps and grooves would pack more tightly.
