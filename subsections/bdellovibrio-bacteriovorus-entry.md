We still do not know exactly how *Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus* enters its host, but the process is extremely rapid. In order to catch a snapshot, we mixed *B. bacteriovorus* with miniaturized prey (see details on the main page). As the *B. bacteriovorus* cell cannot fit inside the prey, it remains stuck half-in and half-out. Note the tight collar of host outer membrane around the invader. How this seal is maintained throughout invasion remains a mystery.
