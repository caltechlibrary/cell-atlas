As you can see in these averages of flagellar motors from different species [@murphy2006] [@chen2011] [@zhao2014] [@beeby2016] [@qin2017] [@chaban2018] [@kaplan2019] [@ferreira2019] [@chang2019], bacteria have evolved various structural adaptations of their motors to better suit their environments. For instance, if your cell is a pathogen colonizing an animalâ€™s intestinal tract (like *Campylobacter jejuni*, second from the right in the middle row), it will be swimming in more viscous conditions and may therefore have evolved a wider stator ring to generate more torque, along with reinforced anchors in the cell wall and outer membrane to withstand that added torque. The motors are arranged here according to the species' evolutionary relatedness.
