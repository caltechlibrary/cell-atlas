The process of forespore engulfment by the mother cell membrane culminates in closure of the membranes, creating an outer spore membrane and an inner spore membrane on either side of the sporulation septum. The final point of separation is usually at the center of the cell pole, but not always, as you can see in this *Bacillus subtilis* forespore being engulfed from the side of the mother cell. The layer to the right of the developing spore may be a precursor of the coat (â‡¨).
