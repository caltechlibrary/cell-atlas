Most of the metabolic work of the cell is performed by proteins. The translation of messenger RNA into new proteins, however, is performed by a hybrid complex containing both proteins and RNA molecules. (You can watch an animation illustrating the process on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_n0Ij3K_Ho).) This ribosome from *Escherichia coli* contains ~50 different protein molecules (shown in cyan) and 3 RNA molecules (in grey) [@kaledhonkar2019]. Electrons interact more strongly with RNA than with protein, making ribosomes stand out darker than surrounding proteins in cryo-EM images. You will also notice their abundance; each cell employs up to tens of thousands of ribosomes to churn out its protein workforce.
