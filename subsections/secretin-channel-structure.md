Many copies of a Secretin protein come together to form a channel, as in this one from a *Vibrio cholerae* type II secretion system [@yan2017a]. In addition to the main channel embedded in the outer membrane, additional domains of the protein form a series of rings in the periplasm that interact with other components of the system. The Secretin channel forms the core of both type II and type III secretion systems, showing that they evolved from the same ancestral machine, adding and repurposing other components over time to serve their different functions.
