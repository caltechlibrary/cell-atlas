*Prosthecobacter vanneervenii* is a stalked bacterium like *Caulobacter crescentus*, and attaches to surfaces by the same mechanism: a sticky ball of holdfast at the tip of its stalk. Here you see four cells whose stalks have attached to one another in the process of sample preparation. Unlike its cousin *C. crescentus*, however, *P. vanneervenii* is non-motile (no flagellum) and does not have a dimorphic life cycle. It divides symmetrically.
