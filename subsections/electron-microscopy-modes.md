In electron microscopy, interactions of the imaging beam with the sample result in scattering events. Different imaging modes detect different types of scattering. Here we focus on two modes: SEM, which detects backscattered electrons and therefore maps the surface of the sample; and TEM, which detects transmitted electrons and therefore projects information about the full sample volume. We will discuss TEM on the next page.
