Light-harvesting photocomplexes, like this one from a red alga (the machinery is closely related to that found in cyanobacteria) [@ma2020], can comprise hundreds of individual proteins and reach tens of nanometers in size. Physically tethering enzymes that function in the same pathway increases efficiency by allowing enzymes that catalyze subsequent steps to hand off substrates. You will see more examples of this theme in the following pages; metabolic enzymes in the cell often cluster together into relay teams.
