Archaea and bacteria with surface layers produce characteristic outer membrane vesicles: they bud off with the surface layer attached. You will see plenty of examples in the coming pages. *Delftia acidovorans* like this produce so-called nanopods: chains of outer membrane vesicles ensheathed in surface layer.
