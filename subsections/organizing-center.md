As you can see more clearly in this lysed, flattened *Thermococcus kodakaraensis* cell, the conical plate in the cytoplasm is attached to more than just the archaella. It is also associated with chemosensory arrays (discussed in the next chapter) and DNA, as you can see from the ribosome-excluding zone. This structure may therefore perform an analogous function to bacterial organizing proteins such as PopZ, tethering cellular components into a *de facto* pole for the (in this case round) cell.
