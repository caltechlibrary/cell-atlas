Many lophotrichous species, like the *Hylemonella gracilis* you saw in Chapter 3 or this *Helicobacter pylori*, have a tuft of flagella at their cell pole. In some species, though, the tuft is located elsewhere; for example, a clump of flagella on the concave side of banana-shaped *Selenomonas artemidis* pushes the cells sideways in a seesawing swimming pattern.
