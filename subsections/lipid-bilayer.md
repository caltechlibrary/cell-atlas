Phospholipids have a hydrophilic head (colored here) and hydrophobic tails (grey); in water they spontaneously pack side-by-side and tail-to-tail to shield their tails from unfavorable interactions with water. This results in closed double-layered bags: membranes. One key difference between archaea and bacteria (and with them, eukaryotes) is the kind of lipid in their membranes. Hybrid membranes containing both these lipid types can be made artificially, and it is possible that the last common ancestor of all cells on Earth contained both types, with specialization occurring later.

Membranes also contain many proteins. Some have hydrophobic regions that embed them into the lipid bilayer. Other proteins are fused, or tethered, to the lipids. In fact, cells' "lipid" membranes are made up of roughly equal parts phospholipids and proteins.
