The helical filament of the flagellum is made up of many copies of one or a few flagellin proteins. Each flagellin monomer has a soluble head domain and a hydrophobic alpha-helical tail that bundles together with the tails of other monomers to form a hollow tube. The tube comprises 11 twisting protofilaments, as you can see in this section of a flagellum from *Bacillus subtilis* [@wang2017].
