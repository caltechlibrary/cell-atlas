A conformational change in the T6SS sheath provides the energy to fire the inner rod toward its target. The remaining sheath is shorter and wider than in its primed state, as in this section of a fired T6SS from *Myxococcus xanthus* [@chang2017]. (You can watch an animation of the firing process on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Xk7rxv6HtKo).)
