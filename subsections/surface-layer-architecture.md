A single protein forms the surface layer you just saw in *Caulobacter crescentus*. The protein has two domains. The bottom domain anchors it to lipoproteins attached to the outer membrane. The top domain, seen here, forms the canopy of the surface layer, organizing hierarchically into hexameric rosettes which in turn pack into a larger hexameric lattice [@bharat2017]. This lattice is flexible enough to curve around even narrow regions of the cell like the stalk you will see in Chapter 4.1.
