		"content": "In the 1960s, electron microscopes were opening a new window in biology,\nallowing scientists to look not just at cells, but into them. This\nrevealed a rich world of ultrastructures too small to resolve with light\nmicroscopes, including organelles inside eukaryotic cells. To share this\nnew vista with scientists and medical students who did not have\nmicroscopes to look for themselves, authors like Don Fawcett\n[2] and John Dodge [3] created atlases of electron\nmicroscopy images that remain valuable resources for biological and\nmedical novices, as well as experts.\n\nMore than fifty years later, we are once again enjoying an expanded view\nof biology, thanks to another great advance in electron microscopy. The\ndevelopment of cryogenic electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, allows us to\nlook inside cells in their native state. This has opened up even the\nsmallest cells for examination, and revealed some surprising things. In\nparticular, bacteria and archaea, orders of magnitude smaller than\neukaryotic cells and lacking prominent organelles, previously seemed to\nbe relatively unstructured bags of nucleic acids and protein. In the\nlast decade, cryo-EM has challenged this idea, revealing a startling\ndegree of structure in these tiny cells. Understanding this intricate\nmolecular machinery is a fascinating pursuit and might enable us to\nengineer new biological tools in the future. And so, inspired by the\natlases of eukaryotic cell structure from the 1960s, here we offer an\natlas of bacterial and archaeal cell structure, highlighting many of the\nmolecular machines we have discovered so far. We hope it will be a\nuseful tool for microbiology courses, serving as a quick introduction to\nthe cells and what they contain before students go on to study aspects\nof biochemistry or medical importance.\n\nJust as the technology of electron microscopy has advanced in the\nintervening decades, the technology of sharing information has similarly\nevolved. Taking advantage of a digital medium, we can share not just\ntwo-dimensional slices through cells, but full three-dimensional volumes\nwith videos and animations. This medium also allows you to tailor your\nexperience. If you want a brief overview, simply follow the main\nnarrative. If you want to go into more depth on a topic, use the \u201cLearn\nMore\u201d buttons to see additional examples and details. If you are\ninterested in a particular species, navigate from the Phylogenetic Tree.\nIf you are interested in a particular structure, try out the Feature\nIndex. The digital format also lends itself to frequent updates so the\ntextbook can better reflect an active field of research. To see what has\nbeen added since the last edition, check out About this Book.\n\nIf you are new to cryo-EM, we suggest starting with Chapter 1, which\ndescribes the methods used in structural biology, particularly cryo-EM.\nIf you are already an expert, or pressed for time, go straight to the\ncells in Chapter 2. Before you do, though, please watch this short\nintroductory video.\n\nAs Charles Darwin wrote in 1837, \u201cI shall always feel respect for every\none who has written a book, let it be what it may, for I had no idea of\nthe trouble which trying to write common English could cost one\u201d\n[4].

So before we\nstart looking at the structures of cells, let us quickly cover some of\nthe techniques we use to see them.\n\nCell biology occurs over a vast scale, from angstrom-level (0.1 nm)\nrearrangements of molecules inside cells to millimeter-level (1,000,000\nnm) interactions between cells. Different tools of structural biology\ncover different ranges of this scale, complementing one another to\nprovide a more complete view (Learn More below \u21e9). To discuss these\ntools, we will start at the \u201cbig\u201d end of the scale and work our way\ndown, from light microscopy to electron microscopy to X-ray\ncrystallography. Our guide will be a cellular structure called the\nflagellum, which bacteria use to swim (you will see how it works in\nChapter 6).\n\nBacteria and archaea are, with very few exceptions, invisible to our\neyes. As you can see with these Staphylococcus aureus being chased\nthrough a field of human blood cells by an immune cell, they are orders\nof magnitude smaller even than eukaryotic cells. As a consequence, they\nwere unknown to us until about 350 years ago, in the seventeenth\ncentury, when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created the first microscopes\ncapable of revealing such tiny cells. The simplest microscope is a\nmagnifying glass which, combined with the lens of your eye, produces a\nmagnified image on your retina. A compound microscope has two or more\nlenses, whose magnifications multiply, and this is what we commonly mean\nwhen we refer to a \u201clight microscope.\u201d\n\nThe cells here were imaged by light microscopy, captured on film by\nDavid Rogers in the 1950s [7]. They illustrate how light\nmicroscopy can reveal general properties, such as the shape, of cells.\nThe video also illustrates how light microscopy can capture not just\nsingle snapshots of cells, but how they grow, divide and move over time.\n",

Specific cellular components\ncan be fluorescently labeled, with a stain or antibody that binds a\nparticular molecule.

While tagging a protein can sometimes change its\nproperties (e.g.\u00a0affecting its function or altering its localization),\nthis technique often enables us to identify where in the cell a protein\nis found, and what it might be doing there.\n\nAs an example, this movie from Howard Berg\u2019s lab [8]\n[9] shows Escherichia coli cells stained by a fluorescent dye\nthat binds to and highlights their flagella \u2013 long, thin appendages that\npropel them through their environment.

		"content": "While fluorescence allows us to highlight subcellular structures, we\nstill cannot resolve much of their detail. This is because the\nresolution of microscopy is limited by the wavelength of the imaging\nbeam. For light microscopy, the wavelength of the photons limits the\nresolution to a few hundred nanometers (more powerful for higher-energy\nblue light and less for lower-energy red). This resolving power is on\nthe order of the width of many bacterial and archaeal cells. There are\nsome technical \u201csuper-resolution\u201d tricks to more finely pinpoint\nfluorescent molecules, but the overall subcellular details of bacteria\nand archaea are beyond the resolution of light microscopy.\n\nOne way to get around the resolution barrier is to use an imaging beam\nof higher-energy/shorter-wavelength particles. The discovery in the\nearly 1900s that electrons have wave-like properties, and the subsequent\nrealization that they can be focused by a \u201clens\u201d consisting of a\ntoroidal magnetic field, led to the development of electron microscopy\n(EM) in the 1930s.\n\nThere are two main electron microscopy approaches (\u21e9). In Scanning\nElectron Microscopy (SEM), we detect electrons that are scattered\nbackward from the sample, producing an image of the surface of the\nsample.

This shows details throughout the cell, not just on\nthe surface.\n\nElectron microscopy, whether SEM or TEM, relies on the interactions of\nelectrons with biological material to create an image. These\ninteractions, however, also present some problems. First, they damage\nthe sample, so exposure has to be limited, which in turn limits the\ncontrast of images, or how much signal we see relative to noise. Second,\nelectrons interact not just with the sample, but also with anything else\nin their path, so imaging must be conducted in a vacuum. This is\nproblematic for biological material, which is mostly water that\ninstantly boils away in a vacuum. To circumvent these problems, we can\ndehydrate samples to remove the water (changing the structure in the\nprocess) and coat them with metal to increase electron dose tolerance\nand contrast. The Shewanella oneidensis cells you saw on the last page\nwere coated with platinum before imaging. In TEM, samples are often\ncoated with a \u201cnegative stain\u201d such as uranyl acetate; the\nelectron-dense (dark in an image) metal pools around the sample, leaving\nthe interior lighter and thereby creating a negative image. This S.\noneidensis cell was negative-stained this way before imaging. The\nresulting projection image again shows the shape of the cell and its\nflagellum, but not many internal details.\n\nThere are more elaborate (and structure-altering) sample preparation\nmethods for TEM, involving \u201cfixing\u201d the sample by chemical crosslinking\nor freezing under high pressure, dehydrating it, embedding it in resin,\nstaining it, and slicing it into thin sections. With these methods,\nelectron microscopists were able to discover many details of eukaryotic\ncells such as their internal organelles. Bacteria and archaea are much\nsmaller, though, and lack many robust prominent structures like\norganelles. As a result, until the twenty-first century, we thought\nbacteria and archaea were structurally unexciting, little more than\nwater balloons filled with small molecules. How wrong we were.\n",

Instead of\ngetting rid of the water, why not just freeze it, since ice sublimates\nvery slowly in a vacuum? The problem is that water expands as it freezes\ninto crystalline ice, damaging the cell in the process. But in the 1980s\nscientists discovered that freezing a sample quickly enough (done by\nrapidly plunging a small volume into a very efficient cryogen like\nliquid ethane) creates a very different kind of ice. The water molecules\nare immobilized so abruptly that they do not have a chance to find\nbinding partners to form a crystal. The result, called \u201cvitreous\u201d ice\nfor its glass-like properties, preserves cells in their native,\nfully-hydrated state. The frozen sample can then be inserted directly\ninto the vacuum of the TEM without needing additional treatment or\nstaining. This technique is called cryogenic electron microscopy, or\ncryo-EM.\n\nHere you see a projection image of a Caulobacter crescentus cell imaged\nby cryo-EM. Let us quickly go through how it was prepared. First a drop\nof culture was placed onto an EM grid. Instead of the glass slides used\nto support samples in a light microscope, EM sample supports are small\ncircular grids of metal, ~3 mm across, overlaid by a thin mesh of carbon\nwith 2 \u03bcm-wide holes. Excess liquid was then blotted away with paper,\nleaving a thin film of sample across the grid. The grid was then plunged\ninto a cryogen, and the frozen sample was imaged in a special TEM that\nkept the sample cold (near the temperature of liquid nitrogen,\napproximately -190\u00baC) so that the vitreous ice did not warm and\ntransition to a more damaging (and opaque) crystalline state. In this\nimage, you can see the edge of one of the holes in the carbon mesh of\nthe grid; note the slightly increased clarity in the hole where there is\nnothing but culture media compared to the region covered by carbon.\nWhenever possible, we choose to image cells lying at least partially in\nholes. You will also notice many small dark circles \u2013 these are gold\nbeads that were added to the sample; you will see why on the next page.\n\nWith cryo-EM, we can start to see the true structure of cells.

To do that, we can use tomography\n(from the Greek for \u201cwriting slices\u201d). The process may be familiar from\nmedical Computed Tomography, or CT, scans. Simply, the object is imaged\nfrom different angles (in a CT scan, the camera moves around the\npatient; in our case we keep the imaging path constant and simply rotate\nthe small sample). This produces a \u201ctilt-series\u201d of projection images\nthat can be digitally processed into a 3D reconstruction of the object:\na tomogram. To compute the reconstruction, we need to be able to\nprecisely align the images, which is difficult because of the low\ncontrast from cryo-EM samples (unstained and sensitive to electron\ndose). This is where the gold beads come in. As you saw on the previous\npage, they provide clear markers in the images to guide the alignment.\n\nHere you see a tilt-series and resulting tomogram of a Caulobacter\ncrescentus cell. In this and following videos, we view the tomogram as a\nseries of slices scanning (or \u201cwriting\u201d) from bottom to top. Note the\nfurther level of detail that this technique provides, separating the\ncell\u2019s structures into their three-dimensional locations. We can also\nrotate the tomogram and slice along a different axis to view structures\nfrom different angles, although not all features are visible at all\nangles (\u21e9).\n\nSince the early 2000s, cryo-ET has transformed our understanding of\nmicrobial cells, revealing their structural richness and diversity, as\nyou will see in the chapters that follow.\n",

This effect, illustrated on the left,\nusually becomes prohibitive beyond 60\u00ba, so a typical tilt-series spans\nonly ~2/3 of the possible angles, leaving a \u201cmissing wedge\u201d of\ninformation corresponding to those high tilt angles, as you can see on\nthe right. The missing wedge blurs densities in the direction of the\nimaging beam.

While in theory electron microscopy can resolve atoms, in\npractice the resolution is limited by many factors including the\nradiation sensitivity and thickness of the sample. For relatively thick\nsamples like the (small) bacterium on the last page, we can achieve ~5\nnm resolution, enough to see the shapes and arrangement of large\nmacromolecular complexes. To boost our resolving power further, we can\ngather strength in numbers. By averaging multiple copies of a structure,\neither from the same tomogram, or from multiple cells in different\ntomograms, we can build up the signal relative to the noise. Here you\nsee an example of this approach, called sub-tomogram averaging, applied\nto the motor that spins the flagellum. Hundreds of Campylobacter jejuni\ncells were imaged by cryo-ET and their individual flagellar motors were\ndigitally extracted from the resulting tomograms and averaged to produce\na higher-resolution view [10]. Note how densities that vary\nbetween motors, indicating that they are not stably associated with the\nstructure, get washed out, while densities that appear in the same place\nin each motor reinforce one another.

But\nparts of it can be purified out of the cell and visualized by cryo-EM\nsingle particle reconstruction. This technique is conceptually similar\nto sub-tomogram averaging, with images of many identical copies of a\nstructure of interest averaged to produce a higher-resolution view.\nInstead of using tomography to see different angles, we take advantage\nof the fact that a random snapshot will capture individual copies in\ndifferent orientations to provide all the views we need from just one or\na few projection images.

And for nearly all species, no\nmatter how many cells an organism eventually contains (probably around\n10 trillion in your case), it started life as a single cell (an egg, in\nyour case). The details vary, but every cell on Earth is the same at\nheart\u2013a DNA-based replicating machine built from just four\nmacromolecules: nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In\nthe environment, molecules interact rarely and randomly. Bringing them\ntogether enables the reproducible reactions required for life. So no\nmatter what the first self-replicating molecules were (likely\nribonucleic acid, or RNA), they were not a cell until they acquired a\ncontainer.\n\nHow would you build a container for a cell? You would probably want a\nporous material that allowed you to sort specific molecules from the\nenvironment. Evolution agrees. All cells are enclosed by a selectively\npermeable membrane, made of phospholipids and proteins (Learn More \u21e9),\nthat allows them to separate their contents from the environment. The\nchemical properties of phospholipids make membranes impermeable to ions\nand large or hydrophilic molecules (but not to water). This property is\na critical feature for the life of the cell (\u21e9).\n\nWith a membrane, your cell now has a clearly delineated exterior and\ninterior. The interior is called the cytoplasm (\u201ccell substance,\u201d from\nthe Latin for something molded, in this case by the membrane). Almost\nall archaea and many bacteria, like these Mycoplasma genitalium cells,\nare monoderms (\u201csingle skin\u201d). This means that their cytoplasm is\nenclosed by a single membrane. At this resolution, the membrane looks\nlike a single dark line, but remember that it is really a bilayer, as\nyou will be able to see in some later examples. The cytoplasm contains\nthe many macromolecules that carry out the various functions of the\ncell\u2019s metabolism. The most prominent are the ribosomes, which produce\nnew proteins (\u21e9).\n\nOther structures you see in this cell function in motility and will be\nexplained in Chapter 6.

Remember that\nwater can pass freely through the membrane, which means that increasing\nthe solute concentration inside relative to the environment outside will\ncause water to rush in as well, introducing a pressure (known as turgor\npressure) on the membrane. Lipid bilayers, unfortunately, are unable to\nwithstand much pressure. If your cell lives exclusively in a constant,\nand fairly high-osmolarity, environment (like our bodies, in the case of\nthe pathogenic Mycoplasma genitalium you just saw), it can balance\ninternal and external osmolarity to minimize turgor pressure on its\nmembrane. But most cells experience more variable, and dilute,\nenvironments. How could you keep your cell from bursting in such\nconditions?\n\nYou might want to add some rigid scaffolding outside the membrane to\nbuttress it against turgor pressure. Nearly all bacteria do this with a\nmaterial called peptidoglycan: long stiff polymers of glycan sugars\ncrosslinked by short peptides into a chain-mail-like mesh. The full\nscaffold of this material surrounding the cell is called its cell wall.\nIn monoderm bacteria like this Listeria monocytogenes, the cell wall is\nsignificantly thicker than the membrane. It comprises several layers of\npeptidoglycan, which are indistinguishable at this resolution, so the\ncell wall appears as a uniformly textured layer (\u21e9). It remains a\nmystery how large molecules can pass through this dense layer on their\nway to and from the cell.\n\nSome archaea also have cell walls, made of a molecule similar to\npeptidoglycan (\u21e9). Most archaea, though, rely on a different structure\nfor support, which you will see in a few pages.\n\nA wall can be a boon to your cell, but it can also prove a liability in\ncertain conditions. For instance, many antibiotics target the cell wall.\nSome bacteria have developed the ability to jettison their walls in such\nconditions, taking on an amorphous, so-called \u201cL-form\u201d (named for the\nLister Institute where it was discovered).\n",

While\nbacteria lack such organelles, many create an additional compartment\noutside the cell with a second, outer membrane. Such bacteria, like the\nHydrogenovibrio crunogenus cell you see here, are called diderms\n(\u201cdouble skin\u201d). The extra compartment between their membranes is known\nas the periplasm (\u201csubstance between\u201d). This antechamber contains a\nunique subset of proteins, many of which function in escorting things\ninto and out of the main cell.\n\nCompared to the inner membrane, the outer membrane has some unique\nproperties. It is more permeable and not proton-tight (so it cannot be\nused to generate ATP). It is also usually asymmetric, with very\ndifferent molecules in the outer leaflet than in the inner (\u21e9). A few\nspecies of bacteria, particularly pathogens, have labile outer membranes\n(you will see an example in Chapter 8.2). Most, however, firmly anchor\ntheir outer membrane to the cell wall (\u21e9).\n\nRather than containing many layers of peptidoglycan like in the Listeria\nmonocytogenes you just saw, the cell wall of diderms is usually composed\nof a single layer of peptidoglycan mesh (\u21e9), which is visible here as a\nthin line in the periplasm. This single-layered cell wall presents a\nconsiderable challenge for growth: how can you remodel it to grow bigger\nwithout letting turgor pressure burst the cell in the process? The\nanswer, as we are beginning to figure out, is very carefully (\u21e9).\n\nThe difference in thickness of monoderm and diderm cell walls enables a\nwell-known classification system: the Gram stain, which binds\npeptidoglycan.

To do this, cells use three tools: an enzyme that links glycan\nsugars into strands, an enzyme that links glycan strands together with\npeptide bonds, and an enzyme that cuts these peptide links to allow new\nstrands to be incorporated.

And shapes come together in different ways, forming\nrepeating units of one, two, three (as on this cell), four, or six\nblocks.\n\nSurface layers are very common in archaea. Most archaea lack cell walls,\nbut their surface layer plays the same role, functioning as external\nscaffolding. Remember, too, that nearly all archaea are monoderms,\nlacking the extra periplasmic compartment that diderms have. Here again\nthe surface layer serves a similar function, making a canopy above the\ncell\u2019s membrane that encloses a pseudo-periplasmic space. Just as with\nthe bacterial periplasm, this space serves as an antechamber for the\ncell, restricting access by large molecules. In some cases, the\npseudo-periplasmic space also contains proteins that function in\nmetabolism.\n",

When no oxygen is present, some\ncells can use an alternative electron acceptor, such as iron or sulfur,\nin a process called anaerobic respiration. This works well when the\nacceptor is soluble and can diffuse into the cell. You can see deposits\nof soluble metal on the membrane of this Shewanella oneidensis cell\nwhich it is likely using for anaerobic respiration.\n\nWhat if the only available acceptor is trapped in a mineral, though? S.\noneidensis have evolved a mechanism to take their metabolism to the\nmineral by extending chains of outer membrane vesicles.\nElectron-carrying proteins called cytochromes in the membrane shuttle\nelectrons to metal oxide minerals in the environment, a conductive\nproperty that lends the appendages the name \u201cnanowires.\u201d The morphology\nof S. oneidensis nanowires is similar to that of other outer membrane\nvesicle chains, with tubular and pearled sections, like the detached\nnanowire you see here.\n\nOther species, like Geobacter sulfurreducens, also use nanowires to\ntransfer electrons to an insoluble acceptor in the environment, but the\nstructure of those nanowires is very different: a long filament made\nfrom stacked cytochrome proteins, resembling a pilus (thin protein\nfilaments you will see in Chapters 6 and 9).\n",

So why not just grant workers a sabbatical\nwhen demand lags and call them back in when things pick up again? Cells\nacross all domains of life have evolved an elegant sabbatical mechanism:\nenzyme polymerization. You already saw an example of this in Chapter 3:\nthe metabolic enzyme CTP synthase. Another example is the\nalcohol-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (AdhE) enzyme that allows Clostridium\nthermocellum like this one to digest cellulose into ethanol. As you can\nsee, AdhE polymerizes into helical filaments called spirosomes.\nPolymerization can either inactivate an enzyme (e.g.\u00a0by occluding its\nactive site), or activate it (e.g.\u00a0by changing its conformation to open\nan active site). Filaments can also regulate activity by changing their\nconformation; for AdhE, it is thought that spirosomes torque between a\ncompact, inactive form to a more extended, active form (what you see\nhere) (\u21e9). Whatever the details, polymerization is a rapid way to\nmobilize (or demobilize) a large number of enzymes for a metabolic task.\n\nUnoccupied workers can also be recruited to other projects.

Asymmetric constriction is most common early\nin division, but it sometimes persists longer (\u21e9). To understand why\nthis happens, we need to take a closer look at how cells divide.\n\nTo divide, your cell\u2019s membrane and cell wall constrict. But remember\nthat the cell wall is resisting the non-trivial force of turgor pressure\npushing outward. So how can it overcome this pressure and grow inward?\nFor almost all bacteria and many archaea, the answer is a protein\ncontractor called FtsZ (Filamenting Temperature-Sensitive mutant Z,\nnamed for a genetic screen for cells that failed to divide, and\ntherefore grew into long filaments). FtsZ is another piece of your\ncell\u2019s cytoskeleton, and is homologous to eukaryotic tubulin. FtsZ\npolymerizes into filaments that are linked to the cell membrane around\nthe division plane (\u21e9). The filaments are highly dynamic, forming,\ndisassembling and reassembling within seconds.\n\nHow does FtsZ find the right spot? There are multiple mechanisms, but an\nelegant one in cells like this involves an inhibitor that localizes to\nthe cell poles, making a repressive gradient that is strongest at the\nends of the cell and weakest in the middle. As the rod-shaped cell\ngrows, the inhibitor concentration at the middle eventually drops low\nenough that FtsZ can polymerize. Most cells also inhibit FtsZ\npolymerization when the genome is still in the way, a mechanism called\n\u201cnucleoid occlusion.\u201d Some species do this with an FtsZ-inhibiting\nprotein called MipZ that concentrates around the ParB chromosomal\nhandle, ensuring that FtsZ filaments do not form until the chromosome is\nclear.\n\nOnce everything is ready (the cell is long enough and the nucleoid out\nof the way), FtsZ filaments form at the division site. Initially, a\nsingle, short filament (or a few) appears. Already, this is enough to\nbegin constricting the cell, which explains why many bacterial cells,\nincluding this one, start to constrict on one side only. FtsZ filaments\nrun parallel to the cell membrane, so they appear as dots in\ncross-section; if we rotate the cell around to look down its long axis,\nwe can see them.\n\nNote: we cannot see the membrane (and any associated FtsZ filaments) all\nthe way around the cell due to the \u201cmissing wedge\u201d of information in\ncryoET imaging.

Many, though, are explorers, using an impressive\nvariety of techniques to move through their environments, finding\nadvantages in places with more food or fewer competitors. In this\nchapter, we explore how your cell might make a mobile home.\n\nMost bacteria and archaea live in liquid, so motility means swimming.\nWhen you are the size of a cell, though, the backstroke does not get you\nvery far. A rough measure called the Reynolds number describes the\nrelative influence of inertia and viscosity on liquid flow, and this\nparameter scales with an organism\u2019s size. In the low-Reynolds-number\nworld of microbes, inertia is virtually nonexistent. When a rod-shaped\nbacterium stops swimming, it gets to coast only about the diameter of a\nhydrogen atom (~1 \u00c5) before stopping. In this molasses-like environment,\nrotary propellers work much better than paddles.\n\nNearly all bacteria that swim use the same propeller: a rotary motor\nembedded in their envelope that spins a long helical fiber called a\nflagellum (\u21e9). A universal joint called the hook connects the filament\nto the motor, translating the rotation. Flagella, like the one on this\nCampylobacter jejuni, are typically many times longer than the cell and\ntake the form of a three-dimensional wave. The filament is highly\ndynamic, as you would expect, and throughout this book, you will see\nexamples caught in various conformations: straight, curved, or in a\ntypical loose helical waveform like this.

Broadly, the motor consists of stationary \u201cstators\u201d that\ndrive rotation of the \u201crotor\u201d to spin the filament. The torque for\nspinning the flagellum comes from small movements in the stators that\nkick the rotor in a circle. The energy for these movements comes from\nthe ion potential across the cell membrane that we discussed in Chapter\n2; the stators provide a conduit for protons (in most species) or sodium\nions (in some marine species) to diffuse down their chemical gradient\ninto the cytoplasm, powering a conformational change in the stators in\nthe process. The energy demands of the machine are high: a single\nrotation requires about 1,000 protons to flow through the stators, and\nthe motor may spin at more than 100 rotations per second. The fact that\ncells pay this energetic cost indicates a strong evolutionary selection\nfor motility, or in other words, the powerful advantage your cell can\ngain by learning to swim.\n\nWhile the basic plan of the motor is the same in different species,\nthere are structural differences that reflect the different environments\nthose species encounter (\u21e9).\n",

How can your cell get all hundred or more\ncomponents (tens of thousands if you count the components of the\nfilament) where they need to go? Making the feat even more impressive,\nthe machine builds itself, assembling from the inside out. First the\ncomponents associated with the inner membrane come together, forming an\n\u201cexport apparatus\u201d which pumps subsequent components across the membrane\nto assemble in the periplasm and outer membrane (if the cell is a\ndiderm).

(You can watch a video\nof Pseudomonas aeruginosa moving with type IV pili on Howard Berg\u2019s\nwebsite.) The pilus motors are the strongest known motors in nature, and\ncan retract pili at up to 1 \u03bcm/s; the combined action of multiple pili\nleads to extremely rapid \u201ctwitching\u201d motility of the cell over a\nsurface.

Chemosensory systems are ancient (they\nwere already present in the common ancestor of bacteria and archaea) and\nwidespread, reflecting their great utility. Chemosensory systems are\ntwo-component signaling systems. The first component is a chemoreceptor\nthat binds a specific chemical, such as a sugar or amino acid. The\nbinding results in a conformational change that propagates down the long\nreceptor (\u21e9), turning off a kinase bound at the other end that controls\nthe state of the second component: a response regulator. These response\nregulator proteins then carry the signal elsewhere in the cell by\ndiffusion.\n\nFor chemotaxis (\u201ctaxis,\u201d or ordered movement, in response to chemicals)\nthe signal is carried to the cell\u2019s motility machinery, type IV pili or\nflagellar motors. Phosphorylated response regulators bind the flagellar\nmotor, switching the direction of rotation. This produces different\nresults depending on the pattern of flagella on the cell. If there is a\nsingle flagellum, as on this Shewanella oneidensis, it switches the\nflagellum between pushing and pulling the cell body, reorienting the\ncell in the process. In peritrichously-flagellated cells like\nEscherichia coli, it brings the flagella into and out of a bundle.\nRemember that bundled flagella drive the cell forward in straight \u201cruns\u201d\nand dissociated flagella \u201ctumble\u201d the cell to try a new direction. (You\ncan watch videos of this on Howard Berg\u2019s website.) Constant feedback\nfrom the chemosensory system switches the balance of\nphosphorylated/unphosphorylated response regulators and therefore keeps\nthe cell heading in the general direction of an attractant chemical cue,\nor away from a repellant.\n\nChemosensory systems form arrays containing many copies of the proteins.\nAs in this S. oneidensis cell, arrays are usually located near the\nflagella they control, with the tips of the chemoreceptors sticking\nthrough the membrane into the periplasm or extracellular space where\nthey can detect signals from the environment. At the other end of the\narray, the associated kinases interact with the response regulators.\nThese kinases, along with an additional structural protein that helps\norganize the array, form a layer that we see as a dense line in the\ncytoplasm.\n",

In other cases, such as\nthese Caulobacter crescentus, it allows the bacterium to thrive in an\nenvironment with low nutrient levels. C. crescentus has a dimorphic\n(\u201ctwo form\u201d) lifecycle. Newborn cells start out life as swarmers, with a\npolar flagellum.

In many cases, cells\nsimply release these antibiotics to the environment, either directly or\nin membrane vesicles, which may travel further. For more specific\ntargeting, though, cells employ a varied array of secretion systems. You\nalready saw some of these nanomachines in Chapter 6: a type III\nsecretion system assembles the flagellum and a type II secretion system\nassembles the archaellum. Another type II secretion system makes (and\nunmakes) type IV pili. Other family members have evolved more\nmilitaristic functions.\n\nType II secretion systems (T2SSs) in Legionella pneumophila like this\npump out effector proteins that enable a complex pathogenic lifecycle.\nL. pneumophila live in several environments: inside amoebae, outside\ncells (but sometimes with others in biofilms), and inside our cells,\nwhere they cause the severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires\u2019 disease. In\neach environment, the T2SS pumps out proteins that facilitate growth\nthere. For instance, once we inhale L. pneumophila with water droplets,\nthey are internalized by our macrophages. They then use their T2SSs to\nsecrete proteins that prevent their pockets in the cell (called\nLegionella-containing vacuoles) from being degraded, and suppress our\ninnate immune response. This gives the bacteria time to replicate and\nestablish a persistent colony. The T2SSs also secrete a toxin protein\nthat breaks down lung tissue.\n\nUnlike the secretion systems in Chapter 6, the T2SS does not build an\nextracellular appendage. Instead, it is thought to work by pumping\nproteins through the envelope channel using a short piston-like\n\u201cpseudo-pilus\u201d (\u21e9), pushing the molecules into the extracellular space.\n(Keep in mind that for these intracellular pathogens, their\nextracellular space is the interior of the host cell.)\n\nL. pneumophila also use another, unrelated machine, a type IV secretion\nsystem (T4SS), to deliver more than 400(!) different kinds of effector\nproteins into host cells to promote infection. You can see multiple\ninactive T4SSs in this cell (\u21e9). We do not yet know what they look like\nduring active secretion, so the mechanism remains unclear. In another\nhuman pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, inactive T4SSs are sometimes seen\nnext to mysterious extracellular tubes, raising the intriguing\npossibility that the structures are somehow related (\u21e9).\n\nThis L. pneumophila cell is not unusual; it is common for pathogenic\nbacteria to employ multiple types of secretion systems.

One of the most\ncommon, and best-studied, pathogenic secretion systems is the type III\nsecretion system (T3SS) that assembles a needle-like toxin delivery\nsystem called the injectisome. T3SS injectisomes and flagellar motors\nare closely related, and the basal machines have similar structures (\u21e9).\nRather than assembling a long helical filament for motility, though,\ninjectisomes form a shorter needle, which you can see on this\nPseudomonas aeruginosa. The needle can penetrate a eukaryotic cell,\ndelivering effectors directly into its cytoplasm that block the immune\nresponse of the host, and lead to cell lysis. (You can watch an\nanimation of this process on YouTube.)\n\nNote: It would be wasteful, or detrimental, for your cell to secrete\ntoxins all the time. Pathogens typically have multi-stage lifecycles,\noften passing through an intermediate host and/or the environment.\nPathogenic machinery like secretion systems are typically only produced\nwhen conditions signal that the cell has reached its target\n(e.g.\u00a0increased temperature or salt concentration). Until then, the\ngenes encoding the protein components are turned off. This cell is\nmissing a protein (ExsD) that turns off expression of these injectisome\ncomponents. As a result, the strain makes injectisomes even outside the\nhost, enabling us to image their structure.\n\nT3SSs are closely related to type II secretion systems (T2SSs) and share\na common element: the channel embedded in the outer membrane, formed by\nmany copies of a protein called a Secretin (\u21e9). The rest of the machine\nlooks very different, though, reflecting their evolution into separate\nmechanisms.\n",

Mutations sometimes alter the ejection\nsequences, rendering a prophage a permanent part of the genome, or\ngenetic recombination may shuffle some or part of the prophage into a\ndifferent part of the genome. Further evolution may then put these\npieces to new use. This may be how bacteria got the contractile weapons\nyou saw in the last chapter, repurposing genes encoding phage tail\ncomponents.\n\nWhether the phage replicates immediately or waits a while as a prophage\nfirst, once the cycle of replication and release starts, it is rapid.\nThe virus hijacks the cell\u2019s protein-making machinery to churn out\npackaging proteins like capsid, and its replication machinery to churn\nout copies of the genome. Genomes are quickly (and very densely) packed\ninto new heads, tails attached if necessary, and the mature phage\nreleased. Not all phage lyse their hosts; some filamentous phage (which\nare commonly beneficial) use secretion machinery to exit without harm.\nMost, though, use proteins that self-assemble into ports in the inner\nmembrane, allowing another phage-encoded protein to access and chew up\nthe cell wall, causing the cell to lyse. Here you can see a snapshot of\nthis process in a Vibrio cholerae cell infected by a phage that is not\nits virulence-enhancing friend. The phage is replicating, and has just\nlysed the cell to make its escape.\n",

		"content": "So what can your cell do to protect itself from these attackers? The\nmost well-known defense is the CRISPR-Cas system now widely used to edit\ngenomes across the tree of life. Its original function, though, is as an\nimmune system similar to our own. Bacterial and archaeal cells \u201crecord\u201d\nsnippets of the genes of infecting phage in their own genome, enabling\nthe cell to rapidly identify and chop up matching genes in future\ninfections, much as our immune system stores the memory of antigen\nfragments for rapid neutralization in the future.\n\nDefense can also be structural. Surface layers may protect cells from\nsome phage. And then there is always distraction. One function of\nextracellular vesicles may be to provide decoys for phage to attack, as\nyou can see with this myophage attacking a Shewanella oneidensis outer\nmembrane vesicle.\n\nThe war between cells and viruses is an ancient one, and continually\nraging. Despite your cell\u2019s best efforts, it is very likely that it will\nend its life in a burst of phage. It is far from alone in this fate,\nthough. In the ocean, it has been estimated that every day phage kill\noff half the bacterial population. But each lysed cell provides a feast\nfor a starving neighbor, and DNA for more evolutionary tinkering,\ncontinuing to shape the weird, wonderful microbial world.\n",

		"content": "To return to the quote from Richard Feynman that opened the book, \u201cIt is\nvery easy to answer many of these fundamental biological questions; you\njust look at the thing!\u201d Now that you have looked at many bacterial and\narchaeal cells, we hope you are beginning to appreciate the structure\nthat underlies their complex lives.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind, though, that we have only highlighted a\nsmall fraction of the components of these cells. Look at any tomogram in\nthe book and notice all the dark spots that are not labeled; each is a\nmacromolecule, or larger complex, with a function for the cell. From\nillustrations of a cellular machine like the flagellar motor, it is easy\nto imagine it acting in isolation. In fact, though, its environment\nlooks more like this beautiful illustration of an Escherichia coli cell\nby David Goodsell [95]. It is simply a part of the crowded\nlife of the cell. And each of these parts, their functions and their\ninteractions have been shaped, and will continue to be shaped, by\nevolution. Biology is very much a work in progress.\n\nOur knowledge of biology is also a work in progress, and we are at an\nearly stage. Many of the structures you saw in this book were\ncharacterized only in the past decade, and most are not yet fully\ncharacterized. Other structures have been observed inside cells, but we\ndo not yet know what they are, or what function they may serve\n(e.g.\u00a0[96]). You saw examples highlighted in white throughout\nthe book.\n\nFinally, the cells we have imaged represent only a fraction of the full\ndiversity of bacteria and archaea. For every bacterial species that has\nbeen cultured in a lab, many more exist in nature, unseen and unknown.\nArchaea, which do not attract human attention with pathogenic functions,\nare even less studied. Some of the most tantalizing species, which\npromise to bring us closer to an understanding of how eukaryotes first\nevolved, have been identified from genetic fragments but have not yet\nmade it into microscopes in the lab. Many questions remain unanswered,\nand much work remains to be done. We hope you will keep looking.\n",
