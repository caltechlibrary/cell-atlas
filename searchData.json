		"content": "In the 1960s, electron microscopes were opening a new window in biology,\nallowing scientists to look not just at cells, but into them. This\nrevealed a rich world of ultrastructures too small to resolve with light\nmicroscopes, including organelles inside eukaryotic cells. To share this\nnew vista with scientists and medical students who did not have\nmicroscopes to look for themselves, authors like Don Fawcett [2] and\nJohn Dodge [3] created atlases of electron microscopy images that remain\nvaluable resources for biological and medical novices, as well as\nexperts.\n\nMore than fifty years later, we are once again enjoying an expanded view\nof biology, thanks to another great advance in electron microscopy. The\ndevelopment of cryogenic electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, allows us to\nlook inside cells in their native state. This has opened up even the\nsmallest cells for examination, and revealed some surprising things. In\nparticular, bacteria and archaea, orders of magnitude smaller than\neukaryotic cells and lacking prominent organelles, previously seemed to\nbe relatively unstructured bags of nucleic acids and protein. In the\nlast decade, cryo-EM has challenged this idea, revealing a startling\ndegree of structure in these tiny cells. Understanding this intricate\nmolecular machinery is a fascinating pursuit and might enable us to\nengineer new biological tools in the future. And so, inspired by the\natlases of eukaryotic cell structure from the 1960s, here we offer an\natlas of bacterial and archaeal cell structure, highlighting many of the\nmolecular machines we have discovered so far. We hope it will be a\nuseful tool for microbiology courses, serving as a quick introduction to\nthe cells and what they contain before students go on to study aspects\nof biochemistry or medical importance.\n\nJust as the technology of electron microscopy has advanced in the\nintervening decades, the technology of sharing information has similarly\nevolved. Taking advantage of a digital medium, we can share not just\ntwo-dimensional slices through cells, but full three-dimensional volumes\nwith videos and animations. This medium also allows you to tailor your\nexperience. If you want a brief overview, simply follow the main\nnarrative. If you want to go into more depth on a topic, use the \u201cLearn\nMore\u201d buttons to see additional examples and details. If you are\ninterested in a particular species, navigate from the Phylogenetic Tree.\nIf you are interested in a particular structure, try out the Feature\nIndex. The digital format also lends itself to frequent updates so the\ntextbook can better reflect an active field of research. To see what has\nbeen added since the last edition, check out About this Book.\n\nIf you are new to cryo-EM, we suggest starting with Chapter 1, which\ndescribes the methods used in structural biology, particularly cryo-EM.\nIf you are already an expert, or pressed for time, go straight to the\ncells in Chapter 2. Before you do, though, please watch this short\nintroductory video.\n\nAs Charles Darwin wrote in 1837, \u201cI shall always feel respect for every\none who has written a book, let it be what it may, for I had no idea of\nthe trouble which trying to write common English could cost one\u201d [4].\nThe task was made immeasurably easier for us by the help of many minds\nand hands.

So before we\nstart looking at the structures of cells, let us quickly cover some of\nthe techniques we use to see them.\n\nCell biology occurs over a vast scale, from angstrom-level (0.1 nm)\nrearrangements of molecules inside cells to millimeter-level (1,000,000\nnm) interactions between cells. Different tools of structural biology\ncover different ranges of this scale, complementing one another to\nprovide a more complete view (Learn More below \u21e9). To discuss these\ntools, we will start at the \u201cbig\u201d end of the scale and work our way\ndown, from light microscopy to electron microscopy to X-ray\ncrystallography. Our guide will be a cellular structure called the\nflagellum, which bacteria use to swim (you will see how it works in\nChapter 6).\n\nBacteria and archaea are, with very few exceptions, invisible to our\neyes. As you can see with these Staphylococcus aureus being chased\nthrough a field of human blood cells by an immune cell, they are orders\nof magnitude smaller even than eukaryotic cells. As a consequence, they\nwere unknown to us until about 350 years ago, in the seventeenth\ncentury, when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created the first microscopes\ncapable of revealing such tiny cells. The simplest microscope is a\nmagnifying glass which, combined with the lens of your eye, produces a\nmagnified image on your retina. A compound microscope has two or more\nlenses, whose magnifications multiply, and this is what we commonly mean\nwhen we refer to a \u201clight microscope.\u201d\n\nThe cells here were imaged by light microscopy, captured on film by\nDavid Rogers in the 1950s [7]. They illustrate how light microscopy can\nreveal general properties, such as the shape, of cells. The video also\nillustrates how light microscopy can capture not just single snapshots\nof cells, but how they grow, divide and move over time.\n",

Specific cellular components\ncan be fluorescently labeled, with a stain or antibody that binds a\nparticular molecule.

While tagging a protein can sometimes change its\nproperties (e.g.\u00a0affecting its function or altering its localization),\nthis technique often enables us to identify where in the cell a protein\nis found, and what it might be doing there.\n\nAs an example, this movie from Howard Berg\u2019s lab [8] [9] shows\nEscherichia coli cells stained by a fluorescent dye that binds to and\nhighlights their flagella \u2013 long, thin appendages that propel them\nthrough their environment.

		"content": "While fluorescence allows us to highlight subcellular structures, we\nstill cannot resolve much of their detail. This is because the\nresolution of microscopy is limited by the wavelength of the imaging\nbeam. For light microscopy, the wavelength of the photons limits the\nresolution to a few hundred nanometers (more powerful for higher-energy\nblue light and less for lower-energy red). This resolving power is on\nthe order of the width of many bacterial and archaeal cells. There are\nsome technical \u201csuper-resolution\u201d tricks to more finely pinpoint\nfluorescent molecules, but the overall subcellular details of bacteria\nand archaea are beyond the resolution of light microscopy.\n\nOne way to get around the resolution barrier is to use an imaging beam\nof higher-energy/shorter-wavelength particles. The discovery in the\nearly 1900s that electrons have wave-like properties, and the subsequent\nrealization that they can be focused by a \u201clens\u201d consisting of a\ntoroidal magnetic field, led to the development of electron microscopy\n(EM) in the 1930s.\n\nThere are two main electron microscopy approaches (\u21e9). In Scanning\nElectron Microscopy (SEM), we detect electrons that are scattered\nbackward from the sample, producing an image of the surface of the\nsample.

This shows details throughout the cell, not just on\nthe surface.\n\nElectron microscopy, whether SEM or TEM, relies on the interactions of\nelectrons with biological material to create an image. These\ninteractions, however, also present some problems. First, they damage\nthe sample, so exposure has to be limited, which in turn limits the\ncontrast of images, or how much signal we see relative to noise. Second,\nelectrons interact not just with the sample, but also with anything else\nin their path, so imaging must be conducted in a vacuum. This is\nproblematic for biological material, which is mostly water that\ninstantly boils away in a vacuum. To circumvent these problems, we can\ndehydrate samples to remove the water (changing the structure in the\nprocess) and coat them with metal to increase electron dose tolerance\nand contrast. The Shewanella oneidensis cells you saw on the last page\nwere coated with platinum before imaging. In TEM, samples are often\ncoated with a \u201cnegative stain\u201d such as uranyl acetate; the\nelectron-dense (dark in an image) metal pools around the sample, leaving\nthe interior lighter and thereby creating a negative image. This S.\noneidensis cell was negative-stained this way before imaging. The\nresulting projection image again shows the shape of the cell and its\nflagellum, but not many internal details.\n\nThere are more elaborate (and structure-altering) sample preparation\nmethods for TEM, involving \u201cfixing\u201d the sample by chemical crosslinking\nor freezing under high pressure, dehydrating it, embedding it in resin,\nstaining it, and slicing it into thin sections. With these methods,\nelectron microscopists were able to discover many details of eukaryotic\ncells such as their internal organelles. Bacteria and archaea are much\nsmaller, though, and lack many robust prominent structures like\norganelles. As a result, until the twenty-first century, we thought\nbacteria and archaea were structurally unexciting, little more than\nwater balloons filled with small molecules. How wrong we were.\n",

Instead of\ngetting rid of the water, why not just freeze it, since ice sublimates\nvery slowly in a vacuum? The problem is that water expands as it freezes\ninto crystalline ice, damaging the cell in the process. But in the 1980s\nscientists discovered that freezing a sample quickly enough (done by\nrapidly plunging a small volume into a very efficient cryogen like\nliquid ethane) creates a very different kind of ice. The water molecules\nare immobilized so abruptly that they do not have a chance to find\nbinding partners to form a crystal. The result, called \u201cvitreous\u201d ice\nfor its glass-like properties, preserves cells in their native,\nfully-hydrated state. The frozen sample can then be inserted directly\ninto the vacuum of the TEM without needing additional treatment or\nstaining. This technique is called cryogenic electron microscopy, or\ncryo-EM.\n\nHere you see a projection image of a Caulobacter crescentus cell imaged\nby cryo-EM. Let us quickly go through how it was prepared. First a drop\nof culture was placed onto an EM grid. Instead of the glass slides used\nto support samples in a light microscope, EM sample supports are small\ncircular grids of metal, ~3 mm across, overlaid by a thin mesh of carbon\nwith 2 \u03bcm-wide holes. Excess liquid was then blotted away with paper,\nleaving a thin film of sample across the grid. The grid was then plunged\ninto a cryogen, and the frozen sample was imaged in a special TEM that\nkept the sample cold (near the temperature of liquid nitrogen,\napproximately -190\u00baC) so that the vitreous ice did not warm and\ntransition to a more damaging (and opaque) crystalline state. In this\nimage, you can see the edge of one of the holes in the carbon mesh of\nthe grid; note the slightly increased clarity in the hole where there is\nnothing but culture media compared to the region covered by carbon.\nWhenever possible, we choose to image cells lying at least partially in\nholes. You will also notice many small dark circles \u2013 these are gold\nbeads that were added to the sample; you will see why on the next page.\n\nWith cryo-EM, we can start to see the true structure of cells.

To do that, we can use tomography\n(from the Greek for \u201cwriting slices\u201d). The process may be familiar from\nmedical Computed Tomography, or CT, scans. Simply, the object is imaged\nfrom different angles (in a CT scan, the camera moves around the\npatient; in our case we keep the imaging path constant and simply rotate\nthe small sample). This produces a \u201ctilt-series\u201d of projection images\nthat can be digitally processed into a 3D reconstruction of the object:\na tomogram. To compute the reconstruction, we need to be able to\nprecisely align the images, which is difficult because of the low\ncontrast from cryo-EM samples (unstained and sensitive to electron\ndose). This is where the gold beads come in. As you saw on the previous\npage, they provide clear markers in the images to guide the alignment.\n\nHere you see a tilt-series and resulting tomogram of a Caulobacter\ncrescentus cell. In this and following videos, we view the tomogram as a\nseries of slices scanning (or \u201cwriting\u201d) from bottom to top. Note the\nfurther level of detail that this technique provides, separating the\ncell\u2019s structures into their three-dimensional locations. We can also\nrotate the tomogram and slice along a different axis to view structures\nfrom different angles, although not all features are visible at all\nangles (\u21e9).\n\nSince the early 2000s, cryo-ET has transformed our understanding of\nmicrobial cells, revealing their structural richness and diversity, as\nyou will see in the chapters that follow.\n",

To boost our resolving power further, we can\ngather strength in numbers. By averaging multiple copies of a structure,\neither from the same tomogram, or from multiple cells in different\ntomograms, we can build up the signal relative to the noise. Here you\nsee an example of this approach, called sub-tomogram averaging, applied\nto the motor that spins the flagellum. Hundreds of Campylobacter jejuni\ncells were imaged by cryo-ET and their individual flagellar motors were\ndigitally extracted from the resulting tomograms and averaged to produce\na higher-resolution view [10]. Note how densities that vary between\nmotors, indicating that they are not stably associated with the\nstructure, get washed out, while densities that appear in the same place\nin each motor reinforce one another.

This technique is conceptually similar\nto sub-tomogram averaging, with images of many identical copies of a\nstructure of interest averaged to produce a higher-resolution view.\nInstead of using tomography to see different angles, we take advantage\nof the fact that a random snapshot will capture individual copies in\ndifferent orientations to provide all the views we need from just one or\na few projection images.

The details vary, but every cell on Earth is the same at\nheart\u2013a DNA-based replicating machine built from just four\nmacromolecules: nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In\nthe environment, molecules interact rarely and randomly. Bringing them\ntogether enables the reproducible reactions required for life. So no\nmatter what the first self-replicating molecules were (likely\nribonucleic acid, or RNA), they were not a cell until they acquired a\ncontainer.\n\nHow would you build a container for a cell? You would probably want a\nporous material that allowed you to sort specific molecules from the\nenvironment. Evolution agrees. All cells are enclosed by a selectively\npermeable membrane, made of phospholipids and proteins (Learn More \u21e9),\nthat allows them to separate their contents from the environment. The\nchemical properties of phospholipids make membranes impermeable to ions\nand large or hydrophilic molecules (but not to water). This property is\na critical feature for the life of the cell (\u21e9).\n\nWith a membrane, your cell now has a clearly delineated exterior and\ninterior. The interior is called the cytoplasm (\u201ccell substance,\u201d from\nthe Latin for something molded, in this case by the membrane). Almost\nall archaea and many bacteria, like these Mycoplasma genitalium cells,\nare monoderms (\u201csingle skin\u201d). This means that their cytoplasm is\nenclosed by a single membrane.

Lipid bilayers, unfortunately, are unable to\nwithstand much pressure. If your cell lives exclusively in a constant,\nand fairly high-osmolarity, environment (like our bodies, in the case of\nthe pathogenic Mycoplasma genitalium you just saw), it can balance\ninternal and external osmolarity to minimize turgor pressure on its\nmembrane. But most cells experience more variable, and dilute,\nenvironments. How could you keep your cell from bursting in such\nconditions?\n\nYou might want to add some rigid scaffolding outside the membrane to\nbuttress it against turgor pressure. Nearly all bacteria do this with a\nmaterial called peptidoglycan: long stiff polymers of glycan sugars\ncrosslinked by short peptides into a chain-mail-like mesh. The full\nscaffold of this material surrounding the cell is called its cell wall.\nIn monoderm bacteria like this Listeria monocytogenes, the cell wall is\nsignificantly thicker than the membrane. It comprises several layers of\npeptidoglycan, which are indistinguishable at this resolution, so the\ncell wall appears as a uniformly textured layer (\u21e9). It remains a\nmystery how large molecules can pass through this dense layer on their\nway to and from the cell.\n\nSome archaea also have cell walls, made of a molecule similar to\npeptidoglycan (\u21e9). Most archaea, though, rely on a different structure\nfor support, which you will see in a few pages.\n\nA wall can be a boon to your cell, but it can also prove a liability in\ncertain conditions.

The extra compartment between their membranes is known\nas the periplasm (\u201csubstance between\u201d). This antechamber contains a\nunique subset of proteins, many of which function in escorting things\ninto and out of the main cell.\n\nCompared to the inner membrane, the outer membrane has some unique\nproperties. It is more permeable and not proton-tight (so it cannot be\nused to generate ATP). It is also usually asymmetric, with very\ndifferent molecules in the outer leaflet than in the inner (\u21e9). A few\nspecies of bacteria, particularly pathogens, have labile outer membranes\n(you will see an example in Chapter 8.2). Most, however, firmly anchor\ntheir outer membrane to the cell wall (\u21e9).\n\nRather than containing many layers of peptidoglycan like in the Listeria\nmonocytogenes you just saw, the cell wall of diderms is usually composed\nof a single layer of peptidoglycan mesh (\u21e9), which is visible here as a\nthin line in the periplasm.

		"content": "Division can also be asymmetric in a different way: how constricted one\nside of the cell is relative to the other. You can see that in this\nCupriavidus necator cell. Asymmetric constriction is most common early\nin division, but it sometimes persists longer (\u21e9). To understand why\nthis happens, we need to take a closer look at how cells divide.\n\nTo divide, your cell\u2019s membrane and cell wall constrict. But remember\nthat the cell wall is resisting the non-trivial force of turgor pressure\npushing outward. So how can it overcome this pressure and grow inward?\nFor almost all bacteria and many archaea, the answer is a protein\ncontractor called FtsZ (Filamenting Temperature-Sensitive mutant Z,\nnamed for a genetic screen for cells that failed to divide, and\ntherefore grew into long filaments). FtsZ is another piece of your\ncell\u2019s cytoskeleton, and is homologous to eukaryotic tubulin. FtsZ\npolymerizes into filaments that are linked to the cell membrane around\nthe division plane (\u21e9). The filaments are highly dynamic, forming,\ndisassembling and reassembling within seconds.\n\nHow does FtsZ find the right spot? There are multiple mechanisms, but an\nelegant one in cells like this involves an inhibitor that localizes to\nthe cell poles, making a repressive gradient that is strongest at the\nends of the cell and weakest in the middle. As the rod-shaped cell\ngrows, the inhibitor concentration at the middle eventually drops low\nenough that FtsZ can polymerize. Most cells also inhibit FtsZ\npolymerization when the genome is still in the way, a mechanism called\n\u201cnucleoid occlusion.\u201d Some species do this with an FtsZ-inhibiting\nprotein called MipZ that concentrates around the ParB chromosomal\nhandle, ensuring that FtsZ filaments do not form until the chromosome is\nclear.\n\nOnce everything is ready (the cell is long enough and the nucleoid out\nof the way), FtsZ filaments form at the division site. Initially, a\nsingle, short filament (or a few) appears. Already, this is enough to\nbegin constricting the cell, which explains why many bacterial cells,\nincluding this one, start to constrict on one side only. FtsZ filaments\nrun parallel to the cell membrane, so they appear as dots in\ncross-section; if we rotate the cell around to look down its long axis,\nwe can see them.\n\nNote: we cannot see the membrane (and any associated FtsZ filaments) all\nthe way around the cell due to the \u201cmissing wedge\u201d of information in\ncryoET imaging.

Many, though, are explorers, using an impressive\nvariety of techniques to move through their environments, finding\nadvantages in places with more food or fewer competitors. In this\nchapter, we explore how your cell might make a mobile home.\n\nMost bacteria and archaea live in liquid, so motility means swimming.\nWhen you are the size of a cell, though, the backstroke does not get you\nvery far. A rough measure called the Reynolds number describes the\nrelative influence of inertia and viscosity on liquid flow, and this\nparameter scales with an organism\u2019s size. In the low-Reynolds-number\nworld of microbes, inertia is virtually nonexistent. When a rod-shaped\nbacterium stops swimming, it gets to coast only about the diameter of a\nhydrogen atom (~1 \u00c5) before stopping. In this molasses-like environment,\nrotary propellers work much better than paddles.\n\nNearly all bacteria that swim use the same propeller: a rotary motor\nembedded in their envelope that spins a long helical fiber called a\nflagellum (\u21e9). A universal joint called the hook connects the filament\nto the motor, translating the rotation. Flagella, like the one on this\nCampylobacter jejuni, are typically many times longer than the cell and\ntake the form of a three-dimensional wave.

Broadly, the motor consists of stationary \u201cstators\u201d that\ndrive rotation of the \u201crotor\u201d to spin the filament. The torque for\nspinning the flagellum comes from small movements in the stators that\nkick the rotor in a circle.

How can your cell get all hundred or more\ncomponents (tens of thousands if you count the components of the\nfilament) where they need to go?

Chemosensory systems are ancient (they\nwere already present in the common ancestor of bacteria and archaea) and\nwidespread, reflecting their great utility. Chemosensory systems are\ntwo-component signaling systems. The first component is a chemoreceptor\nthat binds a specific chemical, such as a sugar or amino acid. The\nbinding results in a conformational change that propagates down the long\nreceptor (\u21e9), turning off a kinase bound at the other end that controls\nthe state of the second component: a response regulator. These response\nregulator proteins then carry the signal elsewhere in the cell by\ndiffusion.\n\nFor chemotaxis (\u201ctaxis,\u201d or ordered movement, in response to chemicals)\nthe signal is carried to the cell\u2019s motility machinery, type IV pili or\nflagellar motors. Phosphorylated response regulators bind the flagellar\nmotor, switching the direction of rotation. This produces different\nresults depending on the pattern of flagella on the cell. If there is a\nsingle flagellum, as on this Shewanella oneidensis, it switches the\nflagellum between pushing and pulling the cell body, reorienting the\ncell in the process. In peritrichously-flagellated cells like\nEscherichia coli, it brings the flagella into and out of a bundle.\nRemember that bundled flagella drive the cell forward in straight \u201cruns\u201d\nand dissociated flagella \u201ctumble\u201d the cell to try a new direction. (You\ncan watch videos of this on Howard Berg\u2019s website.) Constant feedback\nfrom the chemosensory system switches the balance of\nphosphorylated/unphosphorylated response regulators and therefore keeps\nthe cell heading in the general direction of an attractant chemical cue,\nor away from a repellant.\n\nChemosensory systems form arrays containing many copies of the proteins.\nAs in this S. oneidensis cell, arrays are usually located near the\nflagella they control, with the tips of the chemoreceptors sticking\nthrough the membrane into the periplasm or extracellular space where\nthey can detect signals from the environment. At the other end of the\narray, the associated kinases interact with the response regulators.\nThese kinases, along with an additional structural protein that helps\norganize the array, form a layer that we see as a dense line in the\ncytoplasm.\n",

In other cases, such as\nthese Caulobacter crescentus, it allows the bacterium to thrive in an\nenvironment with low nutrient levels. C. crescentus has a dimorphic\n(\u201ctwo form\u201d) lifecycle. Newborn cells start out life as swarmers, with a\npolar flagellum. They swim through the environment (either freshwater or\nsaltwater) until they (hopefully) reach a favorable spot to put down\nroots, which they do by first transiently attaching to a surface with\npili, then making the attachment permanent with a polymer of a sticky\nprotein called \u201choldfast,\u201d which currently holds the record for the\nstrongest known biological adhesive (\u21e9).

In\neach environment, the T2SS pumps out proteins that facilitate growth\nthere. For instance, once we inhale L. pneumophila with water droplets,\nthey are internalized by our macrophages. They then use their T2SSs to\nsecrete proteins that prevent their pockets in the cell (called\nLegionella-containing vacuoles) from being degraded, and suppress our\ninnate immune response. This gives the bacteria time to replicate and\nestablish a persistent colony. The T2SSs also secrete a toxin protein\nthat breaks down lung tissue.\n\nUnlike the secretion systems in Chapter 6, the T2SS does not build an\nextracellular appendage.

Look at any tomogram in\nthe book and notice all the dark spots that are not labeled; each is a\nmacromolecule, or larger complex, with a function for the cell. From\nillustrations of a cellular machine like the flagellar motor, it is easy\nto imagine it acting in isolation. In fact, though, its environment\nlooks more like this beautiful illustration of an Escherichia coli cell\nby David Goodsell [95]. It is simply a part of the crowded life of the\ncell. And each of these parts, their functions and their interactions\nhave been shaped, and will continue to be shaped, by evolution. Biology\nis very much a work in progress.\n\nOur knowledge of biology is also a work in progress, and we are at an\nearly stage. Many of the structures you saw in this book were\ncharacterized only in the past decade, and most are not yet fully\ncharacterized. Other structures have been observed inside cells, but we\ndo not yet know what they are, or what function they may serve\n(e.g.\u00a0[96]). You saw examples highlighted in white throughout the book.\n\nFinally, the cells we have imaged represent only a fraction of the full\ndiversity of bacteria and archaea. For every bacterial species that has\nbeen cultured in a lab, many more exist in nature, unseen and unknown.\nArchaea, which do not attract human attention with pathogenic functions,\nare even less studied. Some of the most tantalizing species, which\npromise to bring us closer to an understanding of how eukaryotes first\nevolved, have been identified from genetic fragments but have not yet\nmade it into microscopes in the lab. Many questions remain unanswered,\nand much work remains to be done. We hope you will keep looking.\n",

		"content": "A species is a unique group of organisms and is the first rung on the\nladder of taxonomic classifications that stretches all the way up to the\nthree domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. How exactly a\nspecies is defined, though, is a surprisingly complicated question,\nespecially for single-celled organisms. For most animals, species\nboundaries are defined by the infertility of offspring from matings\nacross that boundary. This does not always work, though, and many\nspecies are defined by geographical, rather than reproductive,\nseparation. For organisms that reproduce asexually, the boundaries are\neven more nebulous and often simply reflect a fairly arbitrary degree of\ndifference, either morphological or genetic. Also, remember that\nbacteria and archaea frequently exchange genes, or larger stretches of\nDNA, through horizontal gene transfer (for a familiar example, think of\nthe transfer of antibiotic resistance). This further blurs the lines\nbetween species. In an extreme view, perhaps we should think of\nenvironments less as collections of species than as pools of genes\ntemporarily stored in a variety of containers. Still, despite its\ninexactness, taxonomic classification provides a useful way to trace\nbiological traits so we can begin to answer questions like how the\nmachines you see in this book may have evolved.\n\nThis phylogenetic tree shows the relatedness of the species in this\nbook. The length of the branches separating two species from their last\ncommon ancestor is proportional to the amount of time that they have\nbeen evolving separately. Keep in mind that individual species of\nBacteria and Archaea can be as evolutionarily divergent from one another\nas they are from us. The deeper we go into the past, toward the center\nof the tree, the less accurate the predictions of relatedness become.\nThe branch point between Bacteria/Archaea and Eukaryotes is particularly\nhazy, and a topic of lively debate. We\u2019re still discovering new species,\nand even higher-order clades, and the computational tools we have to\ndetect genetic relationships are improving, so this tree, too, will\ncontinue to evolve.\n"

For the first time, to our knowledge,\nour results unambiguously locate the torque-generating stator complexes\nand show that diverse high-torque motors use variants of an ancestrally\nrelated family of structures to scaffold incorporation of additional\nstator complexes at wider radii from the axial driveshaft than in the\nmodel enteric motor. We identify the protein components of these\nadditional scaffold structures and elucidate their sequential assembly,\ndemonstrating that they are required for stator-complex incorporation.\nThese proteins are widespread, suggesting that different bacteria have\ntailored torques to specific environments by scaffolding alternative\nstator placement and number.

Its spontaneous\nbiosynthesis is initiated by the insertion of the MS ring protein FliF\ninto the inner membrane, followed by attachment of the switch protein\nFliG. Assembly of this multiprotein complex is tightly regulated to\navoid nonspecific aggregation, but the molecular mechanisms governing\nflagellar assembly are unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure\nof the cytoplasmic domain of FliF complexed with the N-terminal domain\nof FliG (FliFC-FliGN) from the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Within\nthis complex, FliFC interacted with FliGN through extensive hydrophobic\ncontacts similar to those observed in the FliFC-FliGN structure from the\nthermophile Thermotoga maritima, indicating conservation of the\nFliFC-FliGN interaction across bacterial species. Analysis of the\ncrystal lattice revealed that the heterodimeric complex packs as a\nlinear superhelix via stacking of the armadillo repeat-like motifs (ARM)\nof FliGN. Notably, this linear helix was similar to that observed for\nthe assembly of the FliG middle domain. We validated the in vivo\nrelevance of the FliGN stacking by complementation studies in\nEscherichia coli. Furthermore, structural comparison with apo FliG from\nthe thermophile Aquifex aeolicus indicated that FliF regulates the\nconformational transition of FliG and exposes the complementary ARM-like\nmotifs of FliGN, containing conserved hydrophobic residues. FliF\napparently both provides a template for FliG polymerization and\nspatiotemporally controls subunit interactions within FliG. Our findings\nreveal that a small protein fold can serve as a versatile building block\nto assemble into a multiprotein machinery of distinct shapes for\nspecific functions.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\": \"Xue\", \"given\": \"Chaolun\"},\n{\"family\": \"Lam\", \"given\": \"Kwok Ho\"}, {\"family\": \"Zhang\", \"given\":\n\"Huawei\"}, {\"family\": \"Sun\", \"given\": \"Kailei\"}, {\"family\": \"Lee\",\n\"given\": \"Sai Hang\"}, {\"family\": \"Chen\", \"given\": \"Xin\"}, {\"family\":\n\"Au\", \"given\": \"Shannon Wing Ngor\"}],\u201dcontainer-title\u201c:\u201dJ.

This study reveals the existence of a\nprotein-mediated membrane diffusion barrier in the stalked bacterium\nCaulobacter crescentus. We show that the Caulobacter cell envelope is\ncompartmentalized by macromolecular complexes that prevent the exchange\nof both membrane and soluble proteins between the polar stalk extension\nand the cell body. The barrier structures span the cross-sectional area\nof the stalk and comprise at least four proteins that assemble in a\ncell-cycle-dependent manner. Their presence is critical for cellular\nfitness because they minimize the effective cell volume, allowing faster\nadaptation to environmental changes that require de novo synthesis of\nenvelope proteins.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\": \"Schlimpert\", \"given\": \"S.\"},\n{\"family\": \"Klein\", \"given\": \"E.

Some flagellar motors have diversified by\nrecruiting additional components that influence torque and rotation, but\nlittle is known about the possible diversification and evolution of core\nmotor components. The mechanistic core of flagella is the cytoplasmic C\nring, which functions as a rotor, directional switch, and assembly\nplatform for the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) ATPase. The\nC ring is composed of a ring of FliG proteins and a helical ring of\nsurface presentation of antigen (SPOA) domains from the switch proteins\nFliM and one of two usually mutually exclusive paralogs, FliN or FliY.\nWe investigated the composition, architecture, and function of the C\nring of Campylobacter jejuni, which encodes FliG, FliM, and both FliY\nand FliN by a variety of interrogative approaches. We discovered a\ndiversified C. jejuni C ring containing FliG, FliM, and both FliY, which\nfunctions as a classical FliN-like protein for flagellar assembly, and\nFliN, which has neofunctionalized into a structural role. Specific\nprotein interactions drive the formation of a more complex\nheterooligomeric C. jejuni C-ring structure. We discovered that this\ncomplex C ring has additional cellular functions in polarly localizing\nFlhG for numerical regulation of flagellar biogenesis and spatial\nregulation of division. Furthermore, mutation of the C. jejuni C ring\nrevealed a T3SS that was less dependent on its ATPase complex for\nassembly than were other systems. Our results highlight considerable\nevolved flagellar diversity that impacts motor output, biogenesis, and\ncellular processes in different species. IMPORTANCE The conserved core\nof bacterial flagellar motors reflects a shared evolutionary history\nthat preserves the mechanisms essential for flagellar assembly,\nrotation, and directional switching. In this work, we describe an\nexpanded and diversified set of core components in the Campylobacter\njejuni flagellar C ring, the mechanistic core of the motor. Our work\nprovides insight into how usually conserved core components may have\ndiversified by gene duplication, enabling a division of labor of the\nancestral protein between the two new proteins, acquisition of new roles\nin flagellar assembly and motility, and expansion of the function of the\nflagellum beyond motility, including spatial regulation of cell division\nand numerical control of flagellar biogenesis in C. jejuni. Our results\nhighlight that relatively small changes, such as gene duplications, can\nhave substantial ramifications on the cellular roles of a molecular\nmachine.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\": \"Henderson\", \"given\": \"Louie D.\"},\n{\"family\": \"Matthews-Palmer\", \"given\": \"Teige R.

Rapid and accurate formation of the 70S\ninitiation complex is promoted by initiation factors, which must\ndissociate from the 30S initiation complex before the resulting 70S\nelongation-competent complex can begin the elongation of translation1.\nAlthough comparisons of the structures of the 30S2-5 and 70S4,6-8\ninitiation complexes have revealed that the ribosome, initiation factors\nand fMet-tRNAfMet can acquire different conformations in these\ncomplexes, the timing of conformational changes during formation of the\n70S initiation complex, the structures of any intermediates formed\nduring these rearrangements, and the contributions that these dynamics\nmight make to the mechanism and regulation of initiation remain unknown.\nMoreover, the absence of a structure of the 70S elongation-competent\ncomplex formed via an initiation-factor-catalysed reaction has precluded\nan understanding of the rearrangements to the ribosome, initiation\nfactors and fMet-tRNAfMet that occur during maturation of a 70S\ninitiation complex into a 70S elongation-competent complex.

S-layers protect cells from the outside,\nprovide mechanical stability and also play roles in pathogenicity. In\nsitu structural information about this highly abundant class of proteins\nis scarce, so atomic details of how S-layers are arranged on the surface\nof cells have remained elusive. Here, using purified Caulobacter\ncrescentus019 sole S-layer protein RsaA, we obtained a 2.7 A X-ray\nstructure that shows the hexameric S-layer lattice. We also solved a 7.4\nA structure of the S-layer through electron cryotomography and\nsub-tomogram averaging of cell stalks. The X-ray structure was docked\nunambiguously into the electron cryotomography map, resulting in a\npseudo-atomic-level description of the in vivo S-layer, which agrees\ncompletely with the atomic X-ray lattice model. The cellular S-layer\natomic structure shows that the S-layer is porous, with a largest gap\ndimension of 27 A, and is stabilized by multiple Ca2+ ions bound near\nthe interfaces. This study spans different spatial scales from atoms to\ncells by combining X-ray crystallography with electron cryotomography\nand sub-nanometre-resolution sub-tomogram averaging.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c:\n[{\"family\": \"Bharat\", \"given\": \"T.

Bacteria respond to these forces by\nperforming a type of calculus, integrating over a number of\nenvironmental and behavioral factors to produce a size and shape that\nare optimal for the circumstances in which they live.

However, the precise molecular\narchitecture of bactofilin filaments has remained unclear. Here,\nsequence analysis and electron microscopy results reveal that, in\naddition to being widely distributed across bacteria and archaea,\nbactofilins are also present in a few eukaryotic lineages such as the\nOomycetes. Electron cryomicroscopy analysis demonstrated that the sole\nbactofilin from Thermus thermophilus (TtBac) forms constitutive\nfilaments that polymerize through end-to-end association of the\n\\beta-helical domains. Using a nanobody, we determined the near-atomic\nfilament structure, showing that the filaments are non-polar. A\npolymerization-impairing mutation enabled crystallization and structure\ndetermination, while reaffirming the lack of polarity and the strength\nof the \\beta-stacking interface.

Chlorosomes allow for\nphotosynthesis at very low light intensities by ultra-rapid transfer of\nexcitations to reaction centres and enable organisms with chlorosomes to\nlive at extraordinarily low light intensities under which no other\nphototrophic organisms can grow. This article reviews several aspects of\nchlorosomes: the supramolecular and molecular organizations and the\nlight-harvesting and spectroscopic properties. In addition, it provides\nsome novel information about the organization of the\nbaseplate.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\": \"Oostergetel\", \"given\": \"G.

FtsZ forms\ndynamic filaments close to the membrane at the site of division that\nhave recently been shown to treadmill around the division ring, guiding\nseptal wall synthesis. Here, using X-ray crystallography of\nStaphylococcus aureus FtsZ (SaFtsZ), we reveal how an FtsZ can adopt two\nfunctionally distinct conformations, open and closed. The open form is\nfound in SaFtsZ filaments formed in crystals and also in soluble\nfilaments of Escherichia coli FtsZ as deduced by electron\ncryomicroscopy. The closed form is found within several crystal forms of\ntwo nonpolymerizing SaFtsZ mutants and corresponds to many previous FtsZ\nstructures from other organisms. We argue that FtsZ019s conformational\nswitch is polymerization-associated, driven by the formation of the\nlongitudinal intersubunit interfaces along the filament. We show that\nsuch a switch provides explanations for both how treadmilling may occur\nwithin a single-stranded filament and why filament assembly is\ncooperative. IMPORTANCE The FtsZ protein is a key molecule during\nbacterial cell division. FtsZ forms filaments that organize cell\nmembrane constriction, as well as remodeling of the cell wall, to divide\ncells. FtsZ functions through nucleotide-driven filament dynamics that\nare poorly understood at the molecular level. In particular, mechanisms\nfor cooperative assembly (nonlinear dependency on concentration) and\ntreadmilling (preferential growth at one filament end and loss at the\nother) have remained elusive. Here, we show that most likely all FtsZ\nproteins have two distinct conformations, a 01cclosed01d form in\nmonomeric FtsZ and an 01copen01d form in filaments. The conformational\nswitch that occurs upon polymerization explains cooperativity and, in\nconcert with polymerization-dependent nucleotide hydrolysis, efficient\ntreadmilling of FtsZ polymers.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\": \"Wagstaff\",\n\"given\": \"James M.\"}, {\"family\": \"Tsim\", \"given\": \"Matthew\"}, {\"family\":\n\"Oliva\", \"given\": \"Mar0eda A.\"}, {\"family\": \"Garc0eda-Sanchez\", \"given\":\n\"Alba\"}, {\"family\": \"Kureisaite-Ciziene\", \"given\": \"Danguole\"},\n{\"family\": \"Andreu\", \"given\": \"Jos0e9 Manuel\"}, {\"family\": \"L0f6we\",\n\"given\":\n\"Jan\"}],\u201dcontainer-title\u201c:\u201dmBio\u201c,\u201did\u201c:\u201dwagstaff2017\u201c,\u201dissue\u201c:\u201d3\u201c,\u201dissued\u201c:\n{\u201ddate-parts\u201c: [[2017, 7]]},\u201dpublisher\u201c:\u201dAmerican Society for\nMicrobiology\u201c,\u201dtitle\u201c:\u201dA polymerization-associated structural switch in\nFtsZ that enables treadmilling of model\nfilaments\u201c,\u201dtype\u201c:\u201darticle-journal\u201c,\u201dvolume\u201c:\u201d8\u201c},\n{\u201dDOI\u201c:\u201d10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100814-125211\u201c,\u201dISSN\u201c:\u201d1530-8995\n(Electronic) 1081-0706 (Linking)\u201c,\u201dabstract\u201c:\u201dIf fully stretched out, a\ntypical bacterial chromosome would be nearly 1 mm long, approximately\n1,000 times the length of a cell.

In particular, the\ncell poles - the ends of rod-shaped cells - constitute important\nplatforms for cellular regulation that underlie processes as essential\nas cell cycle progression, cellular differentiation, virulence,\nchemotaxis and growth of appendages. Thus, understanding how the polar\nlocalization of specific proteins is achieved and regulated is a crucial\nquestion in bacterial cell biology. Often, polarly localized proteins\nare recruited to the poles through their interaction with other proteins\nor protein complexes that were already located there, in a so-called\ndiffusion-and-capture mechanism. Bacteria are also starting to reveal\ntheir secrets on how the initial pole 019recognition019 can occur and\nhow this event can be regulated to generate dynamic, reproducible\npatterns in time (for example, during the cell cycle) and space (for\nexample, at a specific cell pole).

The upper limit is set by diffusion of\nthe cell itself, which demands short times for well-defined swimming\npaths. For an organism the size of E. coli, temporal comparisons of the\nconcentrations of chemicals in the environment must be made within a few\nseconds.

Powered by the\nproton-motive force, the flagellum rapidly rotates in either a clockwise\nor counterclockwise direction, which ultimately controls bacterial\nmotility and behavior. Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica have\nserved as important model systems for extensive genetic, biochemical,\nand structural analysis of the flagellum, providing unparalleled\ninsights into its structure, function, and gene regulation. Despite\nthese advances, our understanding of flagellar assembly and rotational\nmechanisms remains incomplete, in part because of the limited structural\ninformation available regarding the intact rotor-stator complex and\nsecretion apparatus. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has become a\nvaluable imaging technique capable of visualizing the intact flagellar\nmotor in cells at molecular resolution. Because the resolution that can\nbe achieved by cryo-ET with large bacteria (such as E. coli and S.\nenterica) is limited, analysis of small-diameter bacteria (including\nBorrelia burgdorferi and Campylobacter jejuni) can provide additional\ninsights into the in situ structure of the flagellar motor and other\ncellular components. This review is focused on the application of\ncryo-ET, in combination with genetic and biophysical approaches, to the\nstudy of flagellar structures and its potential for improving the\nunderstanding of rotor-stator interactions, the rotational switching\nmechanism, and the secretion and assembly of flagellar\ncomponents.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\": \"Zhao\", \"given\": \"X.\"}, {\"family\":\n\"Norris\", \"given\": \"S.

A unique chemotaxis-mediated\nmotility is critical for H. pylori to colonize in the human stomach and\nto establish chronic infection, but the underlying molecular mechanisms\nare not well understood. Here, we employ cryo-electron tomography\n(cryo-ET) to reveal detailed structures of the H. pylori cell envelope,\nincluding the sheathed flagella and chemotaxis arrays. Notably, H.\npylori possesses a distinctive periplasmic cage-like structure with\n18-fold symmetry. We propose that this structure forms a robust platform\nfor recruiting 18 torque generators, which likely provide the higher\ntorque needed for swimming in high-viscosity environments. We also\nreveal a series of key flagellar assembly intermediates, providing\nstructural evidence that flagellar assembly is tightly coupled with the\nbiogenesis of the membrane sheath. Finally, we determine the structure\nof putative chemotaxis arrays at the flagellar pole, which have\nimplications for how the direction of flagellar rotation is regulated.\nTogether, our pilot cryo-ET studies provide novel structural insights\ninto the unipolar flagella of H. pylori and lay a foundation for a\nbetter understanding of the unique motility of this organism. IMPORTANCE\nHelicobacter pylori is a highly motile bacterial pathogen that colonizes\napproximately 50% of the world019s population. H. pylori can move\nreadily within the viscous mucosal layer of the stomach. It has become\nincreasingly clear that its unique flagella-driven motility is essential\nfor successful gastric colonization and pathogenesis. Here, we use\nadvanced imaging techniques to visualize novel in situ structures with\nunprecedented detail in intact H. pylori cells. Remarkably, H. pylori\npossesses multiple unipolar flagella, which are driven by one of the\nlargest flagellar motors found in bacteria. These large motors\npresumably provide the higher torque needed by the bacterial pathogens\nto navigate in the viscous environment of the human stomach.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c:\n[{\"family\": \"Qin\", \"given\": \"Zhuan\"}, {\"family\": \"Lin\", \"given\":\n\"Wei-ting\"}, {\"family\": \"Zhu\", \"given\": \"Shiwei\"}, {\"family\": \"Franco\",\n\"given\": \"Aime T.\"}, {\"family\": \"Liu\", \"given\":\n\"Jun\"}],\u201dcontainer-title\u201c:\u201dJ\nBacteriol\u201c,\u201did\u201c:\u201dqin2017\u201c,\u201dissue\u201c:\u201d3\u201c,\u201dissued\u201c: {\u201ddate-parts\u201c: [[2017,\n2]]},\u201dpublisher\u201c:\u201dAmerican Society for Microbiology\nJournals\u201c,\u201dtitle\u201c:\u201dImaging the motility and chemotaxis machineries in\nHelicobacter pylori by cryo-electron\ntomography\u201c,\u201dtype\u201c:\u201darticle-journal\u201c,\u201dvolume\u201c:\u201d199\u201c},\n{\u201dDOI\u201c:\u201d10.1038/s41598-017-18115-1\u201c,\u201dISSN\u201c:\u201d2045-2322\u201c,\u201dabstract\u201c:\u201dUnderstanding\nthe evolution of molecular machines underpins our understanding of the\ndevelopment of life on earth.

On surfaces, rod-shaped\nvegetative cells move in search of the prey in a coordinated manner,\nforming dynamic multicellular groups referred to as swarms. Within the\nswarms, cells interact with one another and use two separate locomotion\nsystems. Adventurous motility, which drives the movement of individual\ncells, is associated with the secretion of slime that forms trails at\nthe leading edge of the swarms. It has been proposed that cellular\ntraffic along these trails contributes to M. xanthus social behavior via\nstigmergic regulation. However, most of the cells travel in groups by\nusing social motility, which is cell contact-dependent and requires a\nlarge number of individuals. Exopolysaccharides and the retraction of\ntype IV pili at alternate poles of the cells are the engines associated\nwith social motility. When the swarms encounter prey, the population of\nM. xanthus lyses and takes up nutrients from nearby cells. This\ncooperative and highly density-dependent feeding behavior has the\nadvantage that the pool of hydrolytic enzymes and other secondary\nmetabolites secreted by the entire group is shared by the community to\noptimize the use of the degradation products. This multicellular\nbehavior is especially observed in the absence of nutrients. In this\ncondition, M. xanthus swarms have the ability to organize the gliding\nmovements of 1000s of rods, synchronizing rippling waves of oscillating\ncells, to form macroscopic fruiting bodies, with three subpopulations of\ncells showing division of labor. A small fraction of cells either\ndevelop into resistant myxospores or remain as peripheral rods, while\nthe majority of cells die, probably to provide nutrients to allow\naggregation and spore differentiation. Sporulation within multicellular\nfruiting bodies has the benefit of enabling survival in hostile\nenvironments, and increases germination and growth rates when cells\nencounter favorable conditions. Herein, we review how these social\nbacteria cooperate and review the main cell-cell signaling systems used\nfor communication to maintain multicellularity.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\":\n\"Mu0f1oz-Dorado\", \"given\": \"Jos0e9\"}, {\"family\": \"Marcos-Torres\",\n\"given\": \"Francisco J.\"}, {\"family\": \"Garc0eda-Bravo\", \"given\":\n\"Elena\"}, {\"family\": \"Moraleda-Mu0f1oz\", \"given\": \"Aurelio\"}, {\"family\":\n\"P0e9rez\", \"given\": \"Juana\"}],\u201dcontainer-title\u201c:\u201dFront\nMicrobiol\u201c,\u201did\u201c:\u201dmunoz-dorado2016\u201c,\u201dissued\u201c: {\u201ddate-parts\u201c:\n[[2016]]},\u201dkeyword\u201c:\u201dmotility,multicellularity,Myxococcus\nxanthus,predation,prokaryotic\ndevelopment\u201c,\u201dother-ids\u201c:\u201dmunoz-doradoMyxobacteriaMovingKilling2016\u201c,\u201dpage\u201c:\u201d781\u201c,\u201dtitle\u201c:\u201dMyxobacteria:\nMoving, killing, feeding, and surviving\ntogether\u201c,\u201dtitle-short\u201c:\u201dMyxobacteria\u201c,\u201dtype\u201c:\u201darticle-journal\u201c,\u201dvolume\u201c:\u201d7\u201c},\n{\u201dDOI\u201c:\u201d10.1016/j.mib.2015.07.018\u201c,\u201dISSN\u201c:\u201d1369-5274\u201c,\u201dabstract\u201c:\u201dCells\nof Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a rod-shaped bacterium about 6\\mum long,\ndo not have flagella or pili, yet they move over surfaces at speeds of\nabout 2\\mum/s.

These\nspecialized compartments consist of a phospholipid bilayer membrane\nsurrounding magnetic crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4).\nThe morphology of these membrane-bound crystals varies by species with a\nnominal magnetic domain size between 35 and 120 nm. Almost all\nmagnetotactic bacteria arrange their magnetosomes in a chain within the\ncell there by maximizing the magnetic dipole moment of the cell. It is\npresumed that magnetotactic bacteria use magnetotaxis in conjunction\nwith chemotaxis to locate and maintain an optimum position for growth\nand survival based on chemistry, redox and physiology in aquatic\nhabitats with vertical chemical concentration and redox gradients. The\nbiosynthesis of magnetosomes is a complex process that involves several\ndistinct steps including cytoplasmic membrane modifications, iron uptake\nand transport, initiation of crystallization, crystal maturation and\nmagnetosome chain formation. While many mechanistic details remain\nunresolved, magnetotactic bacteria appear to contain the genetic\ndeterminants for magnetosome biomineralization within their genomes in\nclusters of genes that make up what is referred to as the magnetosome\ngene island in some species. In addition, magnetosomes contain a unique\nset of proteins, not present in other cellular fractions, which control\nthe biomineralization process. Through the development of genetic\nsystems, proteomic and genomic work, and the use of molecular and\nbiochemical tools, the functions of a number of magnetosome membrane\nproteins have been demonstrated and the molecular mechanism for the\nbiomineralization of magnetosomes in these organisms is beginning to be\nrevealed.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\": \"Lower\", \"given\": \"Brian H.\"},\n{\"family\": \"Bazylinski\", \"given\": \"Dennis A.\"}],\u201dcontainer-title\u201c:\u201dJ Mol\nMicrob Biotech\u201c,\u201did\u201c:\u201dlower2013\u201c,\u201dissue\u201c:\u201d1-2\u201c,\u201dissued\u201c: {\u201ddate-parts\u201c:\n[[2013]]},\u201dpage\u201c:\u201d63-80\u201c,\u201dpublisher\u201c:\u201dKarger Publishers\u201c,\u201dtitle\u201c:\u201dThe\nbacterial magnetosome: A unique prokaryotic\norganelle\u201c,\u201dtitle-short\u201c:\u201dThe Bacterial\nMagnetosome\u201c,\u201dtype\u201c:\u201darticle-journal\u201c,\u201dvolume\u201c:\u201d23\u201c},\n{\u201dDOI\u201c:\u201d10.7554/eLife.12620\u201c,\u201dISSN\u201c:\u201d2050-084X (Electronic) 2050-084X\n(Linking)\u201c,\u201dabstract\u201c:\u201dBacterial phototaxis was first recognized over a\ncentury ago, but the method by which such small cells can sense the\ndirection of illumination has remained puzzling. The unicellular\ncyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 moves with Type IV pili and\nmeasures light intensity and color with a range of photoreceptors. Here,\nwe show that individual Synechocystis cells do not respond to a\nspatiotemporal gradient in light intensity, but rather they directly and\naccurately sense the position of a light source. We show that\ndirectional light sensing is possible because Synechocystis cells act as\nspherical microlenses, allowing the cell to see a light source and move\ntowards it. A high-resolution image of the light source is focused on\nthe edge of the cell opposite to the source, triggering movement away\nfrom the focused spot.

The T3SS apparatus (T3SA) is structurally\nconserved among diverse bacterial pathogens and consists of a\ncytoplasmic sorting platform, an envelope-spanning basal body, and an\nextracellular needle with tip complex. The sorting platform is essential\nfor effector recognition and powering secretion. Studies using bacterial\n01cminicells01d have revealed an unprecedented level of structural\ndetail of the sorting platform; however, many of the structure-function\nrelationships within this complex remain enigmatic. Here, we report on\nimproved cryo-electron tomographic approaches to enhance the resolution\nof the Shigella T3SA sorting platform (at \\leq2 nm resolution) done in\nconcert with biochemical and genetic methods to define the sorting\nplatform interactome and interactions with the T3SA inner membrane ring\n(IR). We observed that the sorting platform consists of 01cpods01d with\n6-fold symmetry that interact with the Spa47 ATPase via radial\nextensions comprising MxiN.

T4 lysozyme-mediated insertional\nmutagenesis of MxiK revealed its orientation within the sorting platform\nand enabled disruption of interactions with its binding partners, which\nabolished sorting platform assembly.

Remarkably,\nthe extracellular filament represents only the N-terminal half of the\neffector. A programmed secretion arrest sequesters the C-terminal half\nof CdiA, including the toxin domain, in the periplasm prior to\ntarget-cell recognition. Upon binding receptor, CdiA secretion resumes,\nand the periplasmic FHA-2 domain is transferred to the target-cell outer\nmembrane. The C-terminal toxin region of CdiA then penetrates into the\ntarget-cell periplasm, where it is cleaved for subsequent translocation\ninto the cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that the FHA-2 domain assembles\ninto a transmembrane conduit for toxin transport into the periplasm of\ntarget bacteria. We propose that receptor-triggered secretion ensures\nthat FHA-2 export is closely coordinated with integration into the\ntarget-cell outer membrane.\nVideo Abstract\n\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\": \"Ruhe\", \"given\": \"Zachary C.\"}, {\"family\":\n\"Subramanian\", \"given\": \"Poorna\"}, {\"family\": \"Song\", \"given\": \"Kiho\"},\n{\"family\": \"Nguyen\", \"given\": \"Josephine Y.\"}, {\"family\": \"Stevens\",\n\"given\": \"Taylor A.\"}, {\"family\": \"Low\", \"given\": \"David A.\"},\n{\"family\": \"Jensen\", \"given\": \"Grant J.\"}, {\"family\": \"Hayes\", \"given\":\n\"Christopher\nS.\"}],\u201dcontainer-title\u201c:\u201dCell\u201c,\u201did\u201c:\u201druhe2018\u201c,\u201dissue\u201c:\u201d4\u201c,\u201dissued\u201c:\n{\u201ddate-parts\u201c: [[2018,\n11]]},\u201dpage\u201c:\u201d921-933.e14\u201c,\u201dpublisher\u201c:\u201dElsevier\u201c,\u201dtitle\u201c:\u201dProgrammed\nsecretion arrest and receptor-triggered toxin export during\nantibacterial contact-dependent growth\ninhibition\u201c,\u201dtype\u201c:\u201darticle-journal\u201c,\u201dvolume\u201c:\u201d175\u201c},\n{\u201dDOI\u201c:\u201d10.15252/embr.201744072\u201c,\u201dISSN\u201c:\u201d1469-3178 (Electronic)\n1469-221X\n(Linking)\u201c,\u201dPMCID\u201c:\u201dPMC5494534\u201c,\u201dPMID\u201c:\u201d28487352\u201c,\u201dabstract\u201c:\u201dThe type\nVI secretion system (T6SS) is a versatile molecular weapon used by many\nbacteria against eukaryotic hosts or prokaryotic competitors. It\nconsists of a cytoplasmic bacteriophage tail-like structure anchored in\nthe bacterial cell envelope via a cytoplasmic baseplate and a\nperiplasmic membrane complex. Rapid contraction of the sheath in the\nbacteriophage tail-like structure propels an inner tube/spike complex\nthrough the target cell envelope to deliver effectors. While structures\nof purified contracted sheath and purified membrane complex have been\nsolved, because sheaths contract upon cell lysis and purification, no\nstructure is available for the extended sheath. Structural information\nabout the baseplate is also lacking. Here, we use electron\ncryotomography to directly visualize intact T6SS structures inside\nMyxococcus xanthus cells.

Bacteria have evolved a striking array of pathways for\ndelivering proteins into or across cytoplasmic membranes and, when\npresent, outer membranes. Translocated proteins can form part of the\nmembrane landscape, reside in the periplasmic space situated between the\ninner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, deposit on the cell\nsurface, or be released to the extracellular milieu or injected directly\ninto target cells. One protein translocation system, the general\nsecretory pathway, is conserved in all domains of life. A second, the\ntwin-arginine translocation pathway, is also phylogenetically\ndistributed among most bacteria and plant chloroplasts. While all cell\ntypes have evolved additional systems dedicated to the translocation of\nprotein cargoes, the number of such systems in bacteria is now known to\nexceed nine. These dedicated protein translocation systems, which\ninclude the types 1 through 9 secretion systems (T1SSs-T9SSs), the\nchaperone-usher pathway, and type IV pilus system, are the subject of\nthis review. Most of these systems were originally identified and have\nbeen extensively characterized in Gram-negative or diderm (two-membrane)\nspecies. It is now known that several of these systems also have been\nadapted to function in Gram-positive or monoderm (single-membrane)\nspecies, and at least one pathway is found only in monoderms. This\nreview briefly summarizes the distinctive mechanistic and structural\nfeatures of each dedicated pathway, as well as the shared properties,\nthat together account for the broad biological diversity of protein\ntranslocation in bacteria.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\": \"Christie\", \"given\":\n\"Peter J.\"}],\u201dcontainer-title\u201c:\u201dProtein\nJ\u201c,\u201did\u201c:\u201dchristie2019\u201c,\u201dissue\u201c:\u201d4\u201c,\u201dissued\u201c: {\u201ddate-parts\u201c: [[2019,\n8]]},\u201dpage\u201c:\u201d389-408\u201c,\u201dtitle\u201c:\u201dThe Rich Tapestry of Bacterial Protein\nTranslocation Systems\u201c,\u201dtype\u201c:\u201darticle-journal\u201c,\u201dvolume\u201c:\u201d38\u201c},\n{\u201dDOI\u201c:\u201d10.1038/nrmicro.2016.94\u201c,\u201dISSN\u201c:\u201d1740-1534 (Electronic)\n1740-1526 (Linking)\u201c,\u201dabstract\u201c:\u201dBacterial biofilms are formed by\ncommunities that are embedded in a self-produced matrix of extracellular\npolymeric substances (EPS).

Both\nnanostructures enable their producer to kill other bacteria competing\nfor the same ecological niche. Previously, type VI secretion systems and\nparticularly R-type tailocins were considered highly specific, attacking\na rather small range of competitors. Their specificity is conferred by\ncell surface receptors of the target bacterium and receptor-binding\nproteins on tailocin tail fibers and tail fiber-like appendages of T6SS.\nSince many R-type tailocin gene clusters contain only one tail fiber\ngene it was appropriate to expect small R-type tailocin target ranges.\nHowever, recently up to three tail fiber genes and broader target ranges\nhave been reported for one plant-associated Pseudomonas strain. Here, we\nshow that having three tail fiber genes per R-type tailocin gene cluster\nis a common feature of several strains of Gram-negative (often\nplant-associated) bacteria of the genus Kosakonia. Knowledge about the\nspecificity of type VI secretion systems binding to target bacteria is\neven lower than in R-type tailocins. Although the mode of operation\nimplicated specific binding, it was only published recently that type VI\nsecretion systems develop tail fiber-like appendages. Here again\nKosakonia, exhibiting up to three different type VI secretion systems,\nmay provide valuable insights into the antagonistic potential of\nplant-associated bacteria. Current understanding of the diversity and\npotential of phage tail-like particles is fragmentary due to various\nsynonyms and misleading terminology.

Many\narchaeal viruses differ substantially in morphology from bacterial and\neukaryotic viruses and represent unique virus families. The distinct\nnature of archaeal viruses also extends to the gene composition and\narchitectures of their genomes and the properties of the proteins that\nthey encode. Environmental research has revealed prominent roles of\narchaeal viruses in influencing microbial communities in ocean\necosystems, and recent metagenomic studies have uncovered new groups of\narchaeal viruses that infect extremophiles and mesophiles in diverse\nhabitats. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in our\nunderstanding of the genomic and morphological diversity of archaeal\nviruses and the molecular biology of their life cycles and virus-host\ninteractions, including interactions with archaeal CRISPR-Cas systems.\nWe also examine the potential origins and evolution of archaeal viruses\nand discuss their place in the global virosphere.\u201c,\u201dauthor\u201c: [{\"family\":\n\"Prangishvili\", \"given\": \"D.\"}, {\"family\": \"Bamford\", \"given\": \"D.
