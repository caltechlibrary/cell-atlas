Since the new name for the archaeal motility structure was proposed, in 2012, a significant amount of new data on the regulation of transcription of archaella operons, the structure and function of archaellum subunits, their interactions, and cryo-EM data on in situ archaellum complexes in whole cells have been obtained. These data support the notion that the archaellum is evolutionary and structurally unrelated to the flagellum, but instead is related to archaeal and bacterial type IV pili and emphasize that it is a motility structure unique to the Archaea.},

Not only must cells massively compact their genetic material, but they must also organize their DNA in a manner that is compatible with a range of cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair, homologous recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. Recent work, driven in part by technological advances, has begun to reveal the general principles of chromosome organization in bacteria. Here, drawing on studies of many different organisms, we review the emerging picture of how bacterial chromosomes are structured at multiple length scales, highlighting the functions of various DNA-binding proteins and the impact of physical forces. Additionally, we discuss the spatial dynamics of chromosomes, particularly during their segregation to daughter cells. Although there has been tremendous progress, we also highlight gaps that remain in understanding chromosome organization and segregation.},

These filaments support and organize cellular architecture and provide a dynamic network controlling transport and localization within the cell. Here, we review recent discoveries related to a newly appreciated class of self-assembling proteins that expand our view of the bacterial cytoskeleton and provide potential explanations for its evolutionary origins. Specifically, several types of metabolic enzymes can form structures similar to established cytoskeletal filaments and, in some cases, these structures have been repurposed for structural uses independent of their normal roles. The behaviors of these enzymes suggest that some modern cytoskeletal proteins may have evolved from dual-role proteins with catalytic and structural functions.},

To understand this difference better, we combined genetic analyses with electron cryo-tomography subtomogram averaging to determine in situ structures of flagellar motors that produce different torques, fromCampylobacterandVibriospecies. For the first time, to our knowledge, our results unambiguously locate the torque-generating stator complexes and show that diverse high-torque motors use variants of an ancestrally related family of structures to scaffold incorporation of additional stator complexes at wider radii from the axial driveshaft than in the model enteric motor. We identify the protein components of these additional scaffold structures and elucidate their sequential assembly, demonstrating that they are required for stator-complex incorporation. These proteins are widespread, suggesting that different bacteria have tailored torques to specific environments by scaffolding alternative stator placement and number. Our results quantitatively account for different motor torques, complete the assignment of the locations of the major flagellar components, and provide crucial constraints for understanding mechanisms of torque generation and the evolution of multiprotein complexes.},

  abstract = {What is distinctive about bacterial chemotaxis, as compared to, for example, taste in the elephant, is the time over which decisions must be made. The lower limit is set by diffusion of chemicals to and from the cell surface, which demands long times for statistically significant counts. The upper limit is set by diffusion of the cell itself, which demands short times for well-defined swimming paths. For an organism the size of E. coli, temporal comparisons of the concentrations of chemicals in the environment must be made within a few seconds. Although such short time spans might be difficult for the biochemist, they are not so difficult for E. coli, because diffusion can carry a small molecule across the cell in about 1 msec. E. coli has the opposite problem: How does it integrate inputs from many receptors over periods 1000 times as long? The mechanisms for this signal processing are beginning to be understood. We know how most chemical attractants are identified, how temporal comparisons might be made, and how the behavioral output is effected. We know less about how sensory information crosses the cytoplasmic membrane, how the reactions that link the receptors to the flagella generate such high gain, and what actually controls the direction of flagellar rotation. One thing is quite clear: E. coli demands our admiration and respect.},

This structure confirms our previously reported double-stranded, nonstaggered architecture, and reveals the molecular basis for filament formation. While MamK is closest in sequence to the bacterial actin MreB, the longitudinal contacts along each MamK strand most closely resemble those of eukaryotic actin. In contrast, the cross-strand interface, with a surprisingly limited set of contacts, is novel among actin homologs and gives rise to the nonstaggered architecture.},

S-layer proteins are a diverse class of molecules found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and most archaea1-5. S-layers protect cells from the outside, provide mechanical stability and also play roles in pathogenicity. In situ structural information about this highly abundant class of proteins is scarce, so atomic details of how S-layers are arranged on the surface of cells have remained elusive. Here, using purified Caulobacter crescentus' sole S-layer protein RsaA, we obtained a 2.7 A X-ray structure that shows the hexameric S-layer lattice. We also solved a 7.4 A structure of the S-layer through electron cryotomography and sub-tomogram averaging of cell stalks. The X-ray structure was docked unambiguously into the electron cryotomography map, resulting in a pseudo-atomic-level description of the in vivo S-layer, which agrees completely with the atomic X-ray lattice model. The cellular S-layer atomic structure shows that the S-layer is porous, with a largest gap dimension of 27 A, and is stabilized by multiple Ca2+ ions bound near the interfaces. This study spans different spatial scales from atoms to cells by combining X-ray crystallography with electron cryotomography and sub-nanometre-resolution sub-tomogram averaging.},

A change in one part should eventually result in changes in other parts, if the overall function is to be conserved. In bacterial flagella, the filament and the hook have distinct functions and their respective proteins, FliC and FlgE, have different three-dimensional structures. The filament functions as a helical propeller and the hook as a flexible universal joint. Two proteins, FlgK and FlgL, assure a~smooth connectivity between the hook and the filament. Here we show that, in Campylobacter, the 3D structure of FlgK differs from that of its orthologs in Salmonella and Burkholderia, whose structures have previously been solved. Docking the model of the FlgK junction onto the structure of the Campylobacter hook provides some clues about its divergence. These data suggest how evolutionary pressure to adapt to structural constraints, due to the structure of Campylobacter hook, causes divergence of one element of a supra-molecular complex in order to maintain the function of the entire flagellar assembly.},

Significantly, inner- and outer-membrane associated structures have evolved independently multiple times, suggesting that evolution of such structures is facile and poised the {$\epsilon$}-proteobacteria to fuse them to form the high-torque Campylobacter-type motor.},

It consists of a cytoplasmic bacteriophage tail-like structure anchored in the bacterial cell envelope via a cytoplasmic baseplate and a periplasmic membrane complex. Rapid contraction of the sheath in the bacteriophage tail-like structure propels an inner tube/spike complex through the target cell envelope to deliver effectors. While structures of purified contracted sheath and purified membrane complex have been solved, because sheaths contract upon cell lysis and purification, no structure is available for the extended sheath. Structural information about the baseplate is also lacking. Here, we use electron cryotomography to directly visualize intact T6SS structures inside Myxococcus xanthus cells. Using sub-tomogram averaging, we resolve the structure of the extended sheath and membrane-associated components including the baseplate. Moreover, we identify novel extracellular bacteriophage tail fiber-like antennae. These results provide new structural insights into how the extended sheath prevents premature disassembly and how this sophisticated machine may recognize targets.},

The rotation is generated by the stator\textendash{}rotor interaction, coupled with an ion flux through the torque-generating stator. Here we employed cryo-electron tomography to visualize the intact flagellar motor in the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. By analyzing the motor structures of wild-type and stator-deletion mutants, we not only localized the stator complex in situ, but also revealed the stator\textendash{}rotor interaction at an unprecedented detail. Importantly, the stator\textendash{}rotor interaction induces a conformational change in the flagella C-ring. Given our observation that a non-motile mutant, in which proton flux is blocked, cannot generate the similar conformational change, we propose that the proton-driven torque is responsible for the conformational change required for flagellar rotation.},

  abstract = {The bacterial flagellum is one of nature's most amazing and well-studied nanomachines. Its cell-wall-anchored motor uses chemical energy to rotate a microns-long filament and propel the bacterium towards nutrients and away from toxins. While much is known about flagellar motors from certain model organisms, their diversity across the bacterial kingdom is less well characterized, allowing the occasional misrepresentation of the motor as an invariant, ideal machine. Here, we present an electron cryotomographical survey of flagellar motor architectures throughout the Bacteria. While a conserved structural core was observed in all 11 bacteria imaged, surprisingly novel and divergent structures as well as different symmetries were observed surrounding the core. Correlating the motor structures with the presence and absence of particular motor genes in each organism suggested the locations of five proteins involved in the export apparatus including FliI, whose position below the C-ring was confirmed by imaging a deletion strain. The combination of conserved and specially-adapted structures seen here sheds light on how this complex protein nanomachine has evolved to meet the needs of different species.},

  abstract = {The translocation of proteins across membranes is a fundamental cellular function. Bacteria have evolved a striking array of pathways for delivering proteins into or across cytoplasmic membranes and, when present, outer membranes. Translocated proteins can form part of the membrane landscape, reside in the periplasmic space situated between the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, deposit on the cell surface, or be released to the extracellular milieu or injected directly into target cells. One protein translocation system, the general secretory pathway, is conserved in all domains of life. A second, the twin-arginine translocation pathway, is also phylogenetically distributed among most bacteria and plant chloroplasts. While all cell types have evolved additional systems dedicated to the translocation of protein cargoes, the number of such systems in bacteria is now known to exceed nine. These dedicated protein translocation systems, which include the types 1 through 9 secretion systems (T1SSs\textendash{}T9SSs), the chaperone\textendash{}usher pathway, and type IV pilus system, are the subject of this review. Most of these systems were originally identified and have been extensively characterized in Gram-negative or diderm (two-membrane) species. It is now known that several of these systems also have been adapted to function in Gram-positive or monoderm (single-membrane) species, and at least one pathway is found only in monoderms. This review briefly summarizes the distinctive mechanistic and structural features of each dedicated pathway, as well as the shared properties, that together account for the broad biological diversity of protein translocation in bacteria.},

There are two main classes of chemoreceptors: integral inner membrane and soluble cytoplasmic proteins. The latter were identified more recently than integral membrane chemoreceptors and have been studied much less thoroughly. These cytoplasmic chemoreceptors are the subject of this review. Our analysis determined that 14\% of bacterial and 43\% of archaeal chemoreceptors are cytoplasmic, based on currently sequenced genomes. Cytoplasmic chemoreceptors appear to share the same key structural features as integral membrane chemoreceptors, including the formations of homodimers, trimers of dimers, and 12-nm hexagonal arrays within the cell. Cytoplasmic chemoreceptors exhibit varied subcellular locations, with some localizing to the poles and others appearing both cytoplasmic and polar. Some cytoplasmic chemoreceptors adopt more exotic locations, including the formations of exclusively internal clusters or moving dynamic clusters that coalesce at points of contact with other cells. Cytoplasmic chemoreceptors presumably sense signals within the cytoplasm and bear diverse signal input domains that are mostly N terminal to the domain that defines chemoreceptors, the so-called MA domain. Similar to the case for transmembrane receptors, our analysis suggests that the most common signal input domain is the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain, but a variety of other N-terminal domains exist. It is also common, however, for cytoplasmic chemoreceptors to have C-terminal domains that may function for signal input. The most common of these is the recently identified chemoreceptor zinc binding (CZB) domain, found in 8\% of all cytoplasmic chemoreceptors. The widespread nature and diverse signal input domains suggest that these chemoreceptors can monitor a variety of cytoplasmically based signals, most of which remain to be determined.},

Bactofilins have diverse functions, from cell stalk formation in Caulobacter crescentus to chromosome segregation and motility in Myxococcus xanthus. However, the precise molecular architecture of bactofilin filaments has remained unclear. Here, sequence analysis and electron microscopy results reveal that, in addition to being widely distributed across bacteria and archaea, bactofilins are also present in a few eukaryotic lineages such as the Oomycetes. Electron cryomicroscopy analysis demonstrated that the sole bactofilin from Thermus thermophilus (TtBac) forms constitutive filaments that polymerize through end-to-end association of the {$\beta$}-helical domains. Using a nanobody, we determined the near-atomic filament structure, showing that the filaments are non-polar. A polymerization-impairing mutation enabled crystallization and structure determination, while reaffirming the lack of polarity and the strength of the {$\beta$}-stacking interface. To confirm the generality of the lack of polarity, we performed coevolutionary analysis on a large set of sequences. Finally, we determined that the widely conserved N-terminal disordered tail of TtBac is responsible for direct binding to lipid membranes, both on liposomes and in Escherichia coli cells. Membrane binding is probably a common feature of these widespread but only recently discovered filaments of the prokaryotic cytoskeleton.},

L-forms are bacterial variants that lack a cell wall and divide by a variety of processes involving membrane blebbing, tubulation, vesiculation and fission. Their unusual mode of proliferation provides a model for primitive cells and is reminiscent of recently developed in vitro vesicle reproduction processes. Invention of the cell wall may have underpinned the explosion of bacterial life on the Earth. Later innovations in cell envelope structure, particularly the emergence of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, possibly in an early endospore former, seem to have spurned further major evolutionary radiations. Comparative studies of bacterial cell envelope structure may help to resolve the early key steps in evolutionary development of the bacterial domain of life.},

Under chronic nutrient deprivation, however, bacteria orchestrate a switch to stationary phase, conserving energy by altering metabolism and stopping motility. About two-thirds of bacteria use flagella to swim, but how bacteria deactivate this large molecular machine remains unclear. Here, we describe the previously unreported ejection of polar motors by {$\gamma$}-proteobacteria. We show that these bacteria eject their flagella at the base of the flagellar hook when nutrients are depleted, leaving a relic of a former flagellar motor in the outer membrane. Subtomogram averages of the full motor and relic reveal that this is an active process, as a plug protein appears in the relic, likely to prevent leakage across their outer membrane; furthermore, we show that ejection is triggered only under nutritional depletion and is independent of the filament as a possible mechanosensor. We show that filament ejection is a widespread phenomenon demonstrated by the appearance of relic structures in diverse {$\gamma$}-proteobacteria including Plesiomonas shigelloides, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio fischeri, Shewanella putrefaciens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While the molecular details remain to be determined, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism for bacteria to halt costly motility when nutrients become scarce.},

  abstract = {Bacterial flagella are reversible rotary motors that rotate external filaments for bacterial propulsion. Some flagellar motors have diversified by recruiting additional components that influence torque and rotation, but little is known about the possible diversification and evolution of core motor components. The mechanistic core of flagella is the cytoplasmic C ring, which functions as a rotor, directional switch, and assembly platform for the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) ATPase. The C ring is composed of a ring of FliG proteins and a helical ring of surface presentation of antigen (SPOA) domains from the switch proteins FliM and one of two usually mutually exclusive paralogs, FliN or FliY. We investigated the composition, architecture, and function of the C ring of Campylobacter jejuni, which encodes FliG, FliM, and both FliY and FliN by a variety of interrogative approaches. We discovered a diversified C. jejuni C ring containing FliG, FliM, and both FliY, which functions as a classical FliN-like protein for flagellar assembly, and FliN, which has neofunctionalized into a structural role. Specific protein interactions drive the formation of a more complex heterooligomeric C. jejuni C-ring structure. We discovered that this complex C ring has additional cellular functions in polarly localizing FlhG for numerical regulation of flagellar biogenesis and spatial regulation of division. Furthermore, mutation of the C. jejuni C ring revealed a T3SS that was less dependent on its ATPase complex for assembly than were other systems. Our results highlight considerable evolved flagellar diversity that impacts motor output, biogenesis, and cellular processes in different species.
IMPORTANCE The conserved core of bacterial flagellar motors reflects a shared evolutionary history that preserves the mechanisms essential for flagellar assembly, rotation, and directional switching. In this work, we describe an expanded and diversified set of core components in the Campylobacter jejuni flagellar C ring, the mechanistic core of the motor. Our work provides insight into how usually conserved core components may have diversified by gene duplication, enabling a division of labor of the ancestral protein between the two new proteins, acquisition of new roles in flagellar assembly and motility, and expansion of the function of the flagellum beyond motility, including spatial regulation of cell division and numerical control of flagellar biogenesis in C. jejuni. Our results highlight that relatively small changes, such as gene duplications, can have substantial ramifications on the cellular roles of a molecular machine.},

  abstract = {The initiation of bacterial translation involves the tightly regulated joining of the 50S ribosomal subunit to an initiator transfer RNA (fMet-tRNAfMet)-containing 30S ribosomal initiation complex to form a 70S initiation complex, which subsequently matures into a 70S elongation-competent complex. Rapid and accurate formation of the 70S initiation complex is promoted by initiation factors, which must dissociate from the 30S initiation complex before the resulting 70S elongation-competent complex can begin the elongation of translation1. Although comparisons of the structures of the 30S2\textendash{}5 and 70S4,6\textendash{}8 initiation complexes have revealed that the ribosome, initiation factors and fMet-tRNAfMet can acquire different conformations in these complexes, the timing of conformational changes during formation of the 70S initiation complex, the structures of any intermediates formed during these rearrangements, and the contributions that these dynamics might make to the mechanism and regulation of initiation remain unknown. Moreover, the absence of a structure of the 70S elongation-competent complex formed via an initiation-factor-catalysed reaction has precluded an understanding of the rearrangements to the ribosome, initiation factors and fMet-tRNAfMet that occur during maturation of a 70S initiation complex into a 70S elongation-competent complex. Here, using time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy9, we report the near-atomic-resolution view of how a time-ordered series of conformational changes drive and regulate subunit joining, initiation factor dissociation and fMet-tRNAfMet positioning during formation of the 70S elongation-competent complex. Our results demonstrate the power of time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy to determine how a time-ordered series of conformational changes contribute to the mechanism and regulation of one of the most fundamental processes in biology.},

Complementing our imaging with bioinformatics analysis, we find a correlation between the motor's stator system and its structural elaboration. Motors with a single H+-driven stator have only the core periplasmic P- and L-rings; those with dual H+-driven stators have an elaborated P-ring; and motors with Na+ or Na+/H+-driven stators have both their P- and L-rings embellished. Our results suggest an evolution of structural elaboration that may have enabled pathogenic bacteria to colonize higher-viscosity environments in animal hosts.},

They contribute to the metabolic versatility of bacteria, providing a competitive advantage in specific environmental niches.

This progress has not only heightened our understanding of their role in microbial metabolism but is also beginning to enable their use in a variety of applications in synthetic biology.

Central to their spatial organization is the precise positioning of certain proteins in subcellular domains of the cell. In particular, the cell poles - the ends of rod-shaped cells - constitute important platforms for cellular regulation that underlie processes as essential as cell cycle progression, cellular differentiation, virulence, chemotaxis and growth of appendages. Thus, understanding how the polar localization of specific proteins is achieved and regulated is a crucial question in bacterial cell biology. Often, polarly localized proteins are recruited to the poles through their interaction with other proteins or protein complexes that were already located there, in a so-called diffusion-and-capture mechanism. Bacteria are also starting to reveal their secrets on how the initial pole 'recognition' can occur and how this event can be regulated to generate dynamic, reproducible patterns in time (for example, during the cell cycle) and space (for example, at a specific cell pole). Here, we review the major mechanisms that have been described in the literature, with an emphasis on the self-organizing principles. We also present regulation strategies adopted by bacterial cells to obtain complex spatiotemporal patterns of protein localization.},

These inclusions are biomineralized by the magnetotactic bacteria which are ubiquitous, aquatic, motile microorganisms. Magnetosomes cause cells of magnetotactic bacteria to passively align and swim along the Earth's magnetic field lines, as miniature motile compass needles. These specialized compartments consist of a phospholipid bilayer membrane surrounding magnetic crystals of magnetite (Fe\textsubscript{3}O\textsubscript{4}) or greigite (Fe\textsubscript{3}S\textsubscript{4}). The morphology of these membrane-bound crystals varies by species with a nominal magnetic domain size between 35 and 120 nm. Almost all magnetotactic bacteria arrange their magnetosomes in a chain within the cell there by maximizing the magnetic dipole moment of the cell. It is presumed that magnetotactic bacteria use magnetotaxis in conjunction with chemotaxis to locate and maintain an optimum position for growth and survival based on chemistry, redox and physiology in aquatic habitats with vertical chemical concentration and redox gradients. The biosynthesis of magnetosomes is a complex process that involves several distinct steps including cytoplasmic membrane modifications, iron uptake and transport, initiation of crystallization, crystal maturation and magnetosome chain formation. While many mechanistic details remain unresolved, magnetotactic bacteria appear to contain the genetic determinants for magnetosome biomineralization within their genomes in clusters of genes that make up what is referred to as the magnetosome gene island in some species. In addition, magnetosomes contain a unique set of proteins, not present in other cellular fractions, which control the biomineralization process. Through the development of genetic systems, proteomic and genomic work, and the use of molecular and biochemical tools, the functions of a number of magnetosome membrane proteins have been demonstrated and the molecular mechanism for the biomineralization of magnetosomes in these organisms is beginning to be revealed.},

On the basis of this structure, we show that the hook is stabilized by intricate inter-molecular interactions between FlgE molecules. Extra domains in FlgE, found only in Campylobacter and in related bacteria, bring more stability and robustness to the hook. Functional experiments suggest that Campylobacter requires an unusually strong hook to swim without its flagella being torn off. This structure reveals details of the quaternary organization of the hook that consists of 11 protofilaments. Previous study of the flagellar filament of Campylobacter by electron microscopy showed its quaternary structure made of seven protofilaments. Therefore, this study puts in evidence the difference between the quaternary structures of a bacterial filament and its hook.},

On surfaces, rod-shaped vegetative cells move in search of the prey in a coordinated manner, forming dynamic multicellular groups referred to as swarms. Within the swarms, cells interact with one another and use two separate locomotion systems. Adventurous motility, which drives the movement of individual cells, is associated with the secretion of slime that forms trails at the leading edge of the swarms. It has been proposed that cellular traffic along these trails contributes to M. xanthus social behavior via stigmergic regulation. However, most of the cells travel in groups by using social motility, which is cell contact-dependent and requires a large number of individuals. Exopolysaccharides and the retraction of type IV pili at alternate poles of the cells are the engines associated with social motility. When the swarms encounter prey, the population of M. xanthus lyses and takes up nutrients from nearby cells. This cooperative and highly density-dependent feeding behavior has the advantage that the pool of hydrolytic enzymes and other secondary metabolites secreted by the entire group is shared by the community to optimize the use of the degradation products. This multicellular behavior is especially observed in the absence of nutrients. In this condition, M. xanthus swarms have the ability to organize the gliding movements of 1000s of rods, synchronizing rippling waves of oscillating cells, to form macroscopic fruiting bodies, with three subpopulations of cells showing division of labor. A small fraction of cells either develop into resistant myxospores or remain as peripheral rods, while the majority of cells die, probably to provide nutrients to allow aggregation and spore differentiation. Sporulation within multicellular fruiting bodies has the benefit of enabling survival in hostile environments, and increases germination and growth rates when cells encounter favorable conditions. Herein, we review how these social bacteria cooperate and review the main cell-cell signaling systems used for communication to maintain multicellularity.},

  abstract = {The bacterial flagellar motor is an amazing nanomachine: built from approximately 25 different proteins, it uses an electrochemical ion gradient to drive rotation at speeds of up to 300 Hz (refs 1, 2). The flagellar motor consists of a fixed, membrane-embedded, torque-generating stator and a typically bidirectional, spinning rotor that changes direction in response to chemotactic signals. Most structural analyses so far have targeted the purified rotor, and hence little is known about the stator and its interactions. Here we show, using electron cryotomography of whole cells, the in situ structure of the complete flagellar motor from the spirochaete Treponema primitia at 7 nm resolution. Twenty individual motor particles were computationally extracted from the reconstructions, aligned and then averaged. The stator assembly, revealed for the first time, possessed 16-fold symmetry and was connected directly to the rotor, C ring and a novel P-ring-like structure. The unusually large size of the motor suggested mechanisms for increasing torque and supported models wherein critical interactions occur atop the C ring, where our data suggest that both the carboxy-terminal and middle domains of FliG are found.},

While many structural details and properties of PG and the individual enzymes involved are known, how the process is coordinated to maintain cell integrity and rod shape is not understood. We have developed a coarse-grained method to simulate how individual transglycosylases, transpeptidases, and endopeptidases could introduce new material into an existing unilayer PG network. We find that a simple model with no enzyme coordination fails to maintain cell wall integrity and rod shape. We then iteratively analyze failure modes and explore different mechanistic hypotheses about how each problem might be overcome by the macromolecules involved. In contrast to a current theory, which posits that long MreB filaments are needed to coordinate PG insertion sites, we find that local coordination of enzyme activities in individual complexes can be sufficient to maintain cell integrity and rod shape. We also present possible molecular explanations for the existence of monofunctional transpeptidases and glycosidases (glycoside hydrolases), trimeric peptide crosslinks, cell twisting during growth, and synthesis of new strands in pairs.},

In other cases, the function of a structure is lost outside the cell, so that the mechanism can be understood only by observation in situ. In this review, we describe the technique and its history and provide examples of its power when applied to cell biology.

Chlorosomes are the largest known supramolecular antenna systems and contain hundreds of thousands of BChl c/d/e molecules enclosed by a single membrane leaflet and a baseplate. The BChl pigments are organized via self-assembly and do not require proteins to provide a scaffold for efficient light harvesting. Their excitation energy flows via a small protein, CsmA embedded in the baseplate to the photosynthetic reaction centres. Chlorosomes allow for photosynthesis at very low light intensities by ultra-rapid transfer of excitations to reaction centres and enable organisms with chlorosomes to live at extraordinarily low light intensities under which no other phototrophic organisms can grow. This article reviews several aspects of chlorosomes: the supramolecular and molecular organizations and the light-harvesting and spectroscopic properties. In addition, it provides some novel information about the organization of the baseplate.},

  abstract = {Type VI secretion systems and tailocins, two bacterial phage tail-like particles, have been reported to foster interbacterial competition. Both nanostructures enable their producer to kill other bacteria competing for the same ecological niche. Previously, type VI secretion systems and particularly R-type tailocins were considered highly specific, attacking a rather small range of competitors. Their specificity is conferred by cell surface receptors of the target bacterium and receptor-binding proteins on tailocin tail fibers and tail fiber-like appendages of T6SS. Since many R-type tailocin gene clusters contain only one tail fiber gene it was appropriate to expect small R-type tailocin target ranges. However, recently up to three tail fiber genes and broader target ranges have been reported for one plant-associated Pseudomonas strain. Here, we show that having three tail fiber genes per R-type tailocin gene cluster is a common feature of several strains of Gram-negative (often plant-associated) bacteria of the genus Kosakonia. Knowledge about the specificity of type VI secretion systems binding to target bacteria is even lower than in R-type tailocins. Although the mode of operation implicated specific binding, it was only published recently that type VI secretion systems develop tail fiber-like appendages. Here again Kosakonia, exhibiting up to three different type VI secretion systems, may provide valuable insights into the antagonistic potential of plant-associated bacteria. Current understanding of the diversity and potential of phage tail-like particles is fragmentary due to various synonyms and misleading terminology. Consistency in technical terms is a precondition for concerted and purposeful research, which precedes a comprehensive understanding of the specific interaction between bacteria producing phage tail-like particles and their targets. This knowledge is fundamental for selecting and applying tailored, and possibly engineered, producer bacteria for antagonizing plant pathogenic microorganisms.},

The bifunctional AdhE enzyme is conserved in all bacterial kingdoms but also in more phylogenetically distant microorganisms such as green microalgae. It is found as an oligomeric form called spirosomes, for which the function remains elusive. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to obtain structures of Escherichia coli spirosomes in different conformational states. We show that spirosomes contain active AdhE monomers, and that AdhE filamentation is essential for its activity in vitro and function in vivo.

Beyond direct protein coding, genomes encode regulatory information required to orchestrate the proper timing and levels of gene expression and protein synthesis, and contain binding sites and regulatory sequences to co-ordinate the activities of proteins involved in chromosome repair and maintenance. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that yet another level of information is encoded by the bacterial chromosome - the three-dimensional packaging of the chromosomal DNA molecule itself and its positioning relative to the cell. This vast structural blueprint of specific positional information is manifested in various ways, directing chromosome compaction, accessibility, attachment to the cell envelope, supercoiling, and general architecture and arrangement of the chromosome relative to the cell body. Recent studies have begun to identify and characterize novel systems that utilize the three-dimensional spatial information encoded by chromosomal architecture to co-ordinate and direct fundamental cellular processes within the cytoplasm, providing large-scale order within the complex clutter of the cytoplasmic compartment.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen that can cause many gastrointestinal diseases, including ulcers and gastric cancer. A unique chemotaxis-mediated motility is critical for H. pylori to colonize in the human stomach and to establish chronic infection, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we employ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to reveal detailed structures of the H. pylori cell envelope, including the sheathed flagella and chemotaxis arrays. Notably, H. pylori possesses a distinctive periplasmic cage-like structure with 18-fold symmetry. We propose that this structure forms a robust platform for recruiting 18 torque generators, which likely provide the higher torque needed for swimming in high-viscosity environments. We also reveal a series of key flagellar assembly intermediates, providing structural evidence that flagellar assembly is tightly coupled with the biogenesis of the membrane sheath. Finally, we determine the structure of putative chemotaxis arrays at the flagellar pole, which have implications for how the direction of flagellar rotation is regulated. Together, our pilot cryo-ET studies provide novel structural insights into the unipolar flagella of H. pylori and lay a foundation for a better understanding of the unique motility of this organism.
IMPORTANCE Helicobacter pylori is a highly motile bacterial pathogen that colonizes approximately 50\% of the world's population. H. pylori can move readily within the viscous mucosal layer of the stomach. It has become increasingly clear that its unique flagella-driven motility is essential for successful gastric colonization and pathogenesis. Here, we use advanced imaging techniques to visualize novel in situ structures with unprecedented detail in intact H. pylori cells. Remarkably, H. pylori possesses multiple unipolar flagella, which are driven by one of the largest flagellar motors found in bacteria. These large motors presumably provide the higher torque needed by the bacterial pathogens to navigate in the viscous environment of the human stomach.},

Many of the mechanistic details of bacterial replication elongation are well established. However, an understanding of the complexities of how replication initiation is controlled and coordinated with other cellular processes is emerging only slowly. In contrast to eukaryotes, in which replication and segregation are separate in time, the segregation of most newly replicated bacterial genetic loci occurs sequentially soon after replication. We compare the strategies used by chromosomes and plasmids to ensure their accurate duplication and segregation and discuss how these processes are coordinated spatially and temporally with growth and cell division. We also describe what is known about the three conserved families of ATP-binding proteins that contribute to chromosome segregation and discuss their inter-relationships in a range of disparate bacteria.},

Using electron cryotomography, we show that each CdiA effector protein forms a filament extending {$\sim$}33 nm from the cell surface. Remarkably, the extracellular filament represents only the N-terminal half of the effector. A programmed secretion arrest sequesters the C-terminal half of CdiA, including the toxin domain, in the periplasm prior to target-cell recognition. Upon binding receptor, CdiA secretion resumes, and the periplasmic FHA-2 domain is transferred to the target-cell outer membrane. The C-terminal toxin region of CdiA then penetrates into the target-cell periplasm, where it is cleaved for subsequent translocation into the cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that the FHA-2 domain assembles into a transmembrane conduit for toxin transport into the periplasm of target bacteria. We propose that receptor-triggered secretion ensures that FHA-2 export is closely coordinated with integration into the target-cell outer membrane.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Video Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$}},

Here, we show that individual Synechocystis cells do not respond to a spatiotemporal gradient in light intensity, but rather they directly and accurately sense the position of a light source. We show that directional light sensing is possible because Synechocystis cells act as spherical microlenses, allowing the cell to see a light source and move towards it. A high-resolution image of the light source is focused on the edge of the cell opposite to the source, triggering movement away from the focused spot. Spherical cyanobacteria are probably the world's smallest and oldest example of a camera eye.},

These arrays comprise about 100 contractile structures with outward-facing baseplates, linked by tail fibers and a dynamic hexagonal net.

The sorting platform is essential for effector recognition and powering secretion. Studies using bacterial ``minicells'' have revealed an unprecedented level of structural detail of the sorting platform; however, many of the structure-function relationships within this complex remain enigmatic. Here, we report on improved cryo-electron tomographic approaches to enhance the resolution of the Shigella T3SA sorting platform (at {$\leq$}2 nm resolution) done in concert with biochemical and genetic methods to define the sorting platform interactome and interactions with the T3SA inner membrane ring (IR). We observed that the sorting platform consists of ``pods'' with 6-fold symmetry that interact with the Spa47 ATPase via radial extensions comprising MxiN. Most importantly, MxiK maintained an interaction with the IR via specific interactions with the cytoplasmic domain of the IR protein MxiG (MxiGC), which is a noncanonical forkhead-associated domain, and MxiK has an elongated structure that interacts with the IR via MxiGC. T4 lysozyme-mediated insertional mutagenesis of MxiK revealed its orientation within the sorting platform and enabled disruption of interactions with its binding partners, which abolished sorting platform assembly. Finally, a comparison with the homologous interactions in the Salmonella T3SS sorting platform revealed clear differences in their IR-sorting platform interfaces that have possible mechanistic implications.},

Images produced by ECT have led to the proposal that an ancient sporulation-like event gave rise to the second membrane in diderm bacteria. Tomograms of sporulating monoderm and diderm bacterial cells show how sporulation can lead to the generation of diderm cells. Tomograms of Gram-negative and Gram-positive cell walls and purified sacculi suggest that they are more closely related than previously thought and support the hypothesis that they share a common origin. Mapping the distribution of cell envelope architectures onto a recent phylogenetic tree of life indicates that the diderm cell plan, and therefore the sporulation-like event that gave rise to it, must be very ancient. One explanation for this model is that during the cataclysmic transitions of the early Earth, cellular evolution may have gone through a bottleneck in which only spores survived, which implies that the last bacterial common ancestor was a spore.},

  abstract = {Bacteria swim by rotating flagellar filaments that are several micrometers long, but only about 20 nm in diameter. The filaments can exist in different polymorphic forms, having distinct values of curvature and twist. Rotation rates are on the order of 100 Hz. In the past, the motion of individual filaments has been visualized by dark-field or differential-interference-contrast microscopy, methods hampered by intense scattering from the cell body or shallow depth of field, respectively. We have found a simple procedure for fluorescently labeling cells and filaments that allows recording their motion in real time with an inexpensive video camera and an ordinary fluorescence microscope with mercury-arc or strobed laser illumination. We report our initial findings with cells of Escherichia coli. Tumbles (events that enable swimming cells to alter course) are remarkably varied. Not every filament on a cell needs to change its direction of rotation: different filaments can change directions at different times, and a tumble can result from the change in direction of only one. Polymorphic transformations tend to occur in the sequence normal, semicoiled, curly 1, with changes in the direction of movement of the cell body correlated with transformations to the semicoiled form.},

We determined the STIV structure using near-atomic resolution electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography allowing tracing of structural polypeptide chains and visualization of transmembrane proteins embedded in the viral membrane. We propose that the vertex complexes orchestrate virion assembly by coordinating interactions of the membrane and various protein components involved. STIV shares the same coat subunit and penton base protein folds as some eukaryotic and bacterial viruses, suggesting that they derive from a common ancestor predating the divergence of the three kingdoms of life. One architectural motif ({$\beta$}-jelly roll fold) forms virtually the entire capsid (distributed in three different gene products), indicating that a single ancestral protein module may have been at the origin of its evolution.},

When Cano and Borucki isolated a strain of Bacillus sphaericus from an extinct bee trapped in 25-30 million-year-old amber, careful sample selection and stringent sterilization techniques were the keys to acceptance. Here we report the isolation and growth of a previously unrecognized spore-forming bacterium (Bacillus species, designated 2-9-3) from a brine inclusion within a 250 million-year-old salt crystal from the Permian Salado Formation. Complete gene sequences of the 16S ribosomal DNA show that the organism is part of the lineage of Bacillus marismortui and Virgibacillus pantothenticus. Delicate crystal structures and sedimentary features indicate the salt has not recrystallized since formation. Samples were rejected if brine inclusions showed physical signs of possible contamination. Surfaces of salt crystal samples were sterilized with strong alkali and acid before extracting brines from inclusions. Sterilization procedures reduce the probability of contamination to less than 1 in 10(9).},

  abstract = {Bacterial cell division in many organisms involves a constricting cytokinetic ring that is orchestrated by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ. FtsZ forms dynamic filaments close to the membrane at the site of division that have recently been shown to treadmill around the division ring, guiding septal wall synthesis. Here, using X-ray crystallography of Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ (SaFtsZ), we reveal how an FtsZ can adopt two functionally distinct conformations, open and closed. The open form is found in SaFtsZ filaments formed in crystals and also in soluble filaments of Escherichia coli FtsZ as deduced by electron cryomicroscopy. The closed form is found within several crystal forms of two nonpolymerizing SaFtsZ mutants and corresponds to many previous FtsZ structures from other organisms. We argue that FtsZ's conformational switch is polymerization-associated, driven by the formation of the longitudinal intersubunit interfaces along the filament. We show that such a switch provides explanations for both how treadmilling may occur within a single-stranded filament and why filament assembly is cooperative.
IMPORTANCE The FtsZ protein is a key molecule during bacterial cell division. FtsZ forms filaments that organize cell membrane constriction, as well as remodeling of the cell wall, to divide cells. FtsZ functions through nucleotide-driven filament dynamics that are poorly understood at the molecular level. In particular, mechanisms for cooperative assembly (nonlinear dependency on concentration) and treadmilling (preferential growth at one filament end and loss at the other) have remained elusive. Here, we show that most likely all FtsZ proteins have two distinct conformations, a ``closed'' form in monomeric FtsZ and an ``open'' form in filaments. The conformational switch that occurs upon polymerization explains cooperativity and, in concert with polymerization-dependent nucleotide hydrolysis, efficient treadmilling of FtsZ polymers.},

Here we present near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures for flagellar filaments from both Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Seven mutant flagellar filaments in B. subtilis and two in P. aeruginosa capture two different states of the filament. These reliable atomic models of both states reveal conserved molecular interactions in the interior of the filament among B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica. Using the detailed information about the molecular interactions in two filament states, we successfully predict point mutations that shift the equilibrium between those two states. Further, we observe the dimerization of P. aeruginosa outer domains without any perturbation of the conserved interior of the filament. Our results give new insights into how the flagellin sequence has been "tuned" over evolution.Bacterial flagellar filaments are composed almost entirely of a single protein-flagellin-which can switch between different supercoiled states in a highly cooperative manner. Here the authors present near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of nine flagellar filaments, and begin to shed light on the molecular basis of filament switching.},

  abstract = {Why do bacteria have shape? Is morphology valuable or just a trivial secondary characteristic? Why should bacteria have one shape instead of another? Three broad considerations suggest that bacterial shapes are not accidental but are biologically important: cells adopt uniform morphologies from among a wide variety of possibilities, some cells modify their shape as conditions demand, and morphology can be tracked through evolutionary lineages. All of these imply that shape is a selectable feature that aids survival. The aim of this review is to spell out the physical, environmental, and biological forces that favor different bacterial morphologies and which, therefore, contribute to natural selection. Specifically, cell shape is driven by eight general considerations: nutrient access, cell division and segregation, attachment to surfaces, passive dispersal, active motility, polar differentiation, the need to escape predators, and the advantages of cellular differentiation. Bacteria respond to these forces by performing a type of calculus, integrating over a number of environmental and behavioral factors to produce a size and shape that are optimal for the circumstances in which they live. Just as we are beginning to answer how bacteria create their shapes, it seems reasonable and essential that we expand our efforts to understand why they do so.},

Powered by the proton-motive force, the flagellum rapidly rotates in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, which ultimately controls bacterial motility and behavior. Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica have served as important model systems for extensive genetic, biochemical, and structural analysis of the flagellum, providing unparalleled insights into its structure, function, and gene regulation. Despite these advances, our understanding of flagellar assembly and rotational mechanisms remains incomplete, in part because of the limited structural information available regarding the intact rotor-stator complex and secretion apparatus. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has become a valuable imaging technique capable of visualizing the intact flagellar motor in cells at molecular resolution. Because the resolution that can be achieved by cryo-ET with large bacteria (such as E. coli and S. enterica) is limited, analysis of small-diameter bacteria (including Borrelia burgdorferi and Campylobacter jejuni) can provide additional insights into the in situ structure of the flagellar motor and other cellular components. This review is focused on the application of cryo-ET, in combination with genetic and biophysical approaches, to the study of flagellar structures and its potential for improving the understanding of rotor-stator interactions, the rotational switching mechanism, and the secretion and assembly of flagellar components.},
